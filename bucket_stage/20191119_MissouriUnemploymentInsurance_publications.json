Recently, scholars have also debated the normative question of whether the at-will rule is a desirable default, offering various economic arguments in support of a just cause regime. The essay questions whether the existence of implicit agreements for career employment justifies making such informal agreements legally enforceable. Workers cognitive limitations and strategic problems such as signaling and adverse selection produce ambiguous behavioral predictions, and thus they too provide an uncertain basis for reform. A nascent empirical literature has begun to provide valuable information about actual contract practices. Thus, for example, arguments based on adverse selection must confront the inconvenient fact that a significant number of employers (government agencies, unionized firms, and about 15% of nonunion employers) contract for legally enforceable just cause protection.

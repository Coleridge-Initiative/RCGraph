        "abstract": "Objective: To describe the design, implementation, and consumer response to a coupon‐style intervention aimed to increase Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) use at a farmers' market (FM) among Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) participants. Design: A quasi‐experimental trial to evaluate redemption response to 2 coupon interventions; baseline surveys characterized coupon redeemers and non‐redeemers. Setting: Urban. Participants: The TANF recipients were assigned to either a plain (n = 124) or targeted marketing coupon intervention (n = 130). Intervention(s): Both groups received 10 $2 coupons to double fruit and vegetable SNAP purchases at the FM. The targeted marketing group also received an oral presentation designed to reduce perceived barriers to FM use. Main Outcome Measure: Coupon redemption. Analysis: The researchers used t tests and chi‐square/Fisher exact tests to examine associations between redeemers and non‐redeemers; logistic regression was used to adjust for the intervention. Results: No male and few female participants redeemed coupons (6.3%). Among women, those with knowledge of vegetable preparation were 3 times more likely to redeem coupons than were those with little or no knowledge (odds ratio = 3.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–13.77). Conclusions and Implications: Stand‐alone coupon incentive programs may not be a high‐reach strategy for encouraging FM use among the population using TANF. Complementary strategies to build vegetable preparation knowledge and skills are needed.",

        "abstract": "Food shopping decisions are pathways between food environment, diet and health outcomes, including chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. The choices of where to shop and what to buy are interrelated, though a better understanding of this dynamic is needed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's nationally representative Food Acquisitions and Purchase Survey food-at-home dataset was joined with other databases of retailer characteristics and Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI) of purchases. We used linear regression models with general estimating equations to assess relationships between trip, store, and shopper characteristics with trip HEI scores. We examined HEI component scores for conventional supermarkets and discount/limited assortment retailers with descriptive statistics. Overall, 4962 shoppers made 11,472 shopping trips over one-week periods, 2012-2013. Trips to conventional supermarkets were the most common (53.6%), followed by supercenters (18.6%). Compared to conventional supermarkets, purchases at natural/gourmet stores had significantly higher HEI scores (β = 6.48, 95% CI = [4.45, 8.51], while those from \"other\" retailers (including corner and convenience stores) were significantly lower (-3.89, [-5.87, -1.92]). Older participants (versus younger) and women (versus men) made significantly healthier purchases (1.19, [0.29, 2.10]). Shoppers with less than some college education made significantly less-healthy purchases, versus shoppers with more education, as did households participating in SNAP, versus those with incomes above 185% of the Federal Poverty Level. Individual, trip, and store characteristics influenced the healthfulness of foods purchased. Interventions to encourage healthy purchasing should reflect these dynamics in terms of how, where, and for whom they are implemented.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nFederal food assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) help address food insecurity, yet many participants still struggle to afford nutritionally adequate foods. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has committed $100 million to the expansion and evaluation of SNAP healthy food incentives, which match SNAP funds spent on produce. However, little is known about who uses SNAP incentives or how often they are used. This study examines patterns and correlates of use of the SNAP incentive Double Up Food Bucks at all eight participating Detroit farmers markets during 2012-2013.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSNAP/Double Up Food Bucks transactions from handwritten farmers market logs (n=21,541) were linked with state administrative SNAP enrollment data. Frequency of incentive use and characteristics of Double Up Food Bucks users relative to the overall Detroit SNAP-enrolled population were examined, as were market-level characteristics associated with program use. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate predictors of repeat transactions (analyses conducted 2015-2017).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough demographic characteristics of Double Up Food Bucks users reflected those of the overall Detroit SNAP-enrolled population, Double Up Food Bucks users were poorer and disproportionately female. One third of Double Up Food Bucks users had more than one transaction during the 2-year period. Repeat transactions were directly correlated with identifying as white (incidence rate ratio=2.34, 95% CI=2.11, 2.59, p<0.001), and inversely correlated with driving distance from market of first transaction (incidence rate ratio=0.98 per mile, 95% CI=0.98, 0.99, p<0.001). Rates of repeat transactions also varied significantly by market.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAddressing barriers to initial use and return visits can help maximize the impact and reach of SNAP incentives among Americans at highest risk of diet-related disease.",

        "abstract": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps working families meet their nutritional needs. Families whose earned income increases in a given month may have their SNAP benefits abruptly reduced or cut off in the following month. Using sentinel sample data from 2007-15 for families with children younger than age four, we investigated how SNAP benefit reductions or cutoffs resulting from increased income were related to economic hardships (food and energy insecurity, unstable housing, forgone health and/or dental care, and health cost sacrifices) and to caregiver and child health. After we controlled for covariates, we found that the groups whose SNAP benefits were reduced or cut off had significantly increased odds of household and child food insecurity, compared to a group with consistent participation in SNAP. Reduced benefits were associated with 1.43 and 1.22 times greater odds of fair or poor caregiver and child health, respectively. Policy modifications to smooth changes in benefit levels as work incomes improve may protect working families with young children from increased food insecurity, poor health, and forgone care.",

Farmers' markets were not perceived as available or accommodating to shopping needs and affordability and acceptability concerns were expressed. Few were aware of FMs that accepted SNAP. Emerging themes suggested residential segregation and cultural barriers to FM use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nFarmers' market managers, community nutritionists, and researchers should develop interventions that correct common misperceptions about FM products, minimize access barriers, and increase awareness of SNAP payment options. Residential segregation and cultural barriers may have a role in FM use and should be explored further.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nHealthy food incentives matching Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits spent on fruits and vegetables subsidize increased produce consumption among low-income individuals at risk for food insecurity and diet-related disease. Yet many eligible participants do not use these incentives, in part because of limited awareness. This study examined the acceptability and impact of a primary care-based informational intervention on facilitators and barriers to use of the statewide SNAP incentive program Double Up Food Bucks.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFocus groups (n=5) were conducted April-June 2015 among a purposive sample (n=26) of SNAP-enrolled adults from a Michigan health clinic serving low-income patients. All had participated in a waiting room-based informational intervention about Double Up Food Bucks; none had used Double Up Food Bucks before the intervention. Groups were stratified by Double Up Food Bucks use/non-use during the 6-month intervention period. Results were analyzed in 2016-2017 through an iterative content analysis process.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants reported the waiting room intervention was acceptable and a key facilitator of first-time Double Up Food Bucks use. Motivators for Double Up Food Bucks use included (1) eating more healthfully, (2) stretching SNAP benefits, (3) higher-quality produce at markets, and (4) unique market environments. Remaining barriers included (1) lack of transportation, (2) limited market locations/hours, and (3) persistent confusion among a small number of participants regarding incentive use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLow-income patients who received an informational intervention about Double Up Food Bucks reported numerous benefits from participation. Yet barriers remained for a subset of patients. Improving geographic accessibility and ease of SNAP incentive redemption may further improve dietary quality and food security among vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Amid growing concern about childhood obesity, the United States spends billions of dollars on food assistance: providing meals and subsidizing food purchases. We examine the relationship between food assistance and body mass index (BMI) for young, low-income children, who are a primary target population for federal food programs and for efforts to prevent childhood obesity. Our findings indicate that food assistance may unintentionally contribute to the childhood obesity problem in cities with high food prices. We also find that subsidized meals at school or day care are beneficial for children's weight status, and we argue that expanding access to subsidized meals may be the most effective tool to use in combating obesity in poor children.",

        "abstract": "This exploratory study examines combinations of income-tested welfare benefits and earnings, as they relate to the likelihood of child maltreatment investigations among low-income families with young children participating in a nutritional assistance program in one U.S. state (Wisconsin). Using a sample of 1065 parents who received the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits in late 2010 and early 2011, we find that relying on either work in the absence of other means-tested welfare benefits, or a combination of work and welfare benefits, reduces the likelihood of CPS involvement compared to parents who rely on welfare benefits in the absence of work. Additionally, we find that housing instability increases the risk of CPS involvement in this population. The findings from this investigation may be useful to programs serving low-income families with young children, as they attempt to identify safety net resources for their clientele.",

        "abstract": "Rates of substantiated child abuse and neglect vary significantly across counties. Despite strong cross-sectional support for links between social-contextual characteristics and abuse and neglect, few longitudinal studies have tested relations between these risk factors and substantiated rates of abuse/neglect. The goal of this study was to identify county-level socioeconomic and crime factors associated with substantiated abuse/neglect rates over 13 years (2004-2016). Annual county-level data for Tennessee, obtained from the KIDS COUNT Data Center, included rates of substantiated child abuse and neglect, children's race and ethnicity, births to unmarried women, teen birth rate, children in families receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and children in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Annual county-level crime report data, obtained from the Tennessee Incident Based Reporting System, included sexual offenses, non-sexual assaults, stalking incidents, thefts, property damage, and drug-related offenses. Bayesian spatio-temporal models indicated that substantiated child abuse and neglect rates were independently and positively associated with teen birth rates, percentages of births to unmarried mothers, drug-related offenses, and percentages of children receiving SNAP benefits. In contrast, substantiated child abuse and neglect rates were negatively associated with percentages of African-American youth. The findings highlighted distinct demographic, socioeconomic, and crime factors associated with substantiated child abuse and neglect rates and have the potential to enhance identification of high-risk counties that could benefit from targeted abuse and neglect prevention efforts.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis article investigates the association between Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation and child food security by using data from the largest national survey of the food security of SNAP participants to date.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe analysis used a survey of nearly 3000 households with children and a quasi-experimental research design that consisted of 2 sets of comparisons. Using a cross-sectional sample, we compared information collected from SNAP households within days of program entry with information collected from a contemporaneous sample of SNAP households that had participated for ∼6 months. Next, by using a longitudinal sample, we compared baseline information collected from new-entrant SNAP households with information from those same households 6 months later. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate associations between SNAP and child food security.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSNAP participation was associated with an approximately one-third decrease in the odds of children being food insecure in both samples. In the cross-sectional analysis only, SNAP was also associated with a decrease in the odds of children experiencing severe food insecurity (designated very low food security). Findings were qualitatively robust to different empirical specifications.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter controlling for other possible confounders, we found children in households that had participated in SNAP for 6 months experienced improvements in food security. On the basis of these findings, we conclude SNAP serves a vital role in improving the health and well-being of low-income children by increasing food security. Future research is needed to determine whether specific groups of children experience differential improvements in food security.",

The largest health care challenge was in accessing care coordination, with 49%-56% of children with parent-reported speech-language difficulties lacking full access. Children with parent-reported speech-language difficulties were more likely than peers without any indications of speech-language difficulties to live in households experiencing each measured material hardship and participating in each measured public benefit program (e.g., 20%-22% experiencing food insecurity, compared to 11%-14% of their peers without any indications of speech-language difficulties).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found mixed preliminary evidence to suggest that the prevalence of parent-reported speech-language difficulties among children may be rising. These children face heightened levels of material hardship and barriers in accessing health care.",

In particular, this paper considers findings from a recent RCT of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program rebates, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Healthy Incentives Pilot, in the context of the broader literature on rebate strategies. The paper concludes that rebates have a moderate impact on food intake, at moderate cost relative to alternative interventions. There is further evidence that implicit promotional effects may contribute to impacts of rebate interventions, beyond the impacts of price effects alone. However, existing studies on complementary effects of explicit promotion have been limited by relatively small sample sizes and correspondingly low power to detect differences. This appears to be a promising area for future research.",

We applied near-far matching, which strengthens standard matching by combining it with instrumental variables analysis, to the nationally-representative National Household Food Acquisition and Purchasing Survey (FoodAPS, N = 10,360, years 2012-13).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn ordinary least squares regressions controlling for individual demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, SNAP was associated with increased BMI (+1.23 kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.63). While propensity-score-based analysis replicated this finding, using instrumental variables analysis and particularly near-far matching to strengthen the instruments' discriminatory power revealed the association between SNAP and BMI was likely confounded by unmeasured covariates (+0.21 kg/m2, 95% CI: -3.88, 4.29).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrevious reports of an association between SNAP and obesity should be viewed with caution, and use of near-far matching may assist similar assessments of health effects of social programs.",

We link Medicaid claims data to monthly Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) participation data from the state of Missouri from 2010 to 2013 to explore monthly patterns in children's emergency room (ER) claims for asthma and to examine whether these patterns are sensitive to the timing and amount of SNAP benefits. This allows us to empirically test whether SNAP households with Medicaid insurance face trade-offs between food and medicine that increases the likelihood that a child in a SNAP and Medicaid household will go to the ER for asthma at the end of the month. While we do not find overwhelming evidence that the timing of SNAP benefits receipt are associated with the timing of asthma-related ER visits, we do find clear evidence that increased SNAP benefits are associated with a reduction in the overall probability of an asthma-related ER visit.",

        "abstract": "One in seven Americans participates in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), making it the largest federally funded food assistance program. SNAP benefits are distributed once per month and both food spending and calorie consumption tend to decrease as time from benefit distribution increases. The monthly SNAP benefit cycle has serious implications for the health and financial stability of low-income families, a growing number of whom rely on SNAP as their sole source of income. Relatively little is known about the specific coping strategies households use to manage the SNAP cycle. The purpose of this study is to provide a critical exploration of the nature and timing of coping strategies for managing the SNAP cycle, including implications these coping mechanisms have for health and financial stability. This paper presents data from a prospective cohort study of mothers (n = 12) receiving SNAP benefits in Philadelphia between 2016 and 17. Both in-depth qualitative and survey methods were used. Participants reported on a variety of coping strategies they used to manage the SNAP cycle, including adjustments to shopping and eating patterns, mental accounting, emotional resilience, and social support. Instrumental social support was particularly vital in the final days of the benefit cycle, as were skipping meals and purchasing less expensive, energy-dense foods. Constant vigilance was required throughout the month to manage financial instability. The coping strategies for managing the SNAP cycle have short-term benefits, such as buffering against hunger and financial instability, however these survival strategies may have negative long-term repercussions for physical and financial health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFood insecurity remains a public health concern in the United States, particularly among low-income urban ethnically diverse families, even with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Limited phenomenologic data exist to capture how programmatic changes to SNAP address the needs of users and why a gap in SNAP use may exist.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe primary aim of this study was to examine the experiences of low-income, Baltimore, MD, mothers in applying for and maintaining access to SNAP. Secondary aims included understanding participants' perspectives on the influence of changes in SNAP over a 3-year period and how SNAP fits into the overall system of social services for families.\n\n\nDESIGN\nIn this qualitative, phenomenologic study, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 mothers and three focus groups with 20 mothers, for a total sample of 33 mothers receiving SNAP benefits. Ten mothers participated in the first round of data collection (January to May 2010), and 23 in the second round (February to May 2013).\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nParticipants were 33 mothers receiving SNAP benefits in Baltimore City, MD.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBaltimore SNAP users' experiences with applying for and maintaining access to SNAP, as well as with program changes to the SNAP program.\n\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nData were analyzed using an iterative emergent design and phenomenologic approach. A constructivist perspective was implemented throughout the coding process.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSNAP functioned as a valuable support system within the broader social safety net for mothers living in poverty, yet participants expressed frustration about the processes of applying for and maintaining benefits due to communication problems and poor integration of services. In applying for and accessing SNAP, positive interactions with caseworkers and previous knowledge of the SNAP program were important for maintaining benefits. Interviews and focus group discussions revealed the need for additional outreach and education about the implemented program changes to build trust and improve access to SNAP among participants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImproving communication and supporting participants' ability to maintain relationships with the same caseworkers, as well as developing better integration with other aid programs, could improve the SNAP program.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity is a leading public health challenge in the United States today. This is primarily due to the magnitude of the problem, ∼50 million persons are food insecure (i.e., they were uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food because they had insufficient money or other resources), and the serious negative health and other outcomes associated with being food insecure. This paper defines the measure used to delineate whether a household is food insecure. The measure, the Core Food Security Module, is based on 18 questions about a household's food situation. From the responses, a household is defined as food secure, low food secure, or very low food secure, with the latter 2 categories defined as \"food insecure.\" I next discuss the extent of food insecurity in the US across various dimensions and the key determinants of food insecurity. The key policy tool used to address food insecurity is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; formerly known as the Food Stamp Program). During the current economic downturn, >40 million persons are enrolled in SNAP, with total benefits of >$70 billion. This makes it the largest food assistance program and the largest near-cash assistance program in the US. After defining the eligibility criteria, I review the literature, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of SNAP in addressing its key goal, namely the alleviation of food insecurity in the US. I conclude with 4 suggestions for how SNAP can maintain and even improve its effectiveness in alleviating food insecurity.",

The analyses included 1776 SNAP participants and eligible nonparticipants. SNAP participants had higher odds of obesity (odds ratio [OR] =2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-4.36) and of reporting a mental health problem (OR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.68-8.44) than eligible nonparticipants; however, mental health was not a mediator in the association between SNAP participation and obesity. We recommend changes in SNAP to promote healthier food habits among participants and reduce the stress associated with participation.",

        "abstract": "Up to 25% of postpartum women experience psychological distress including stress, depressive, or anxiety symptoms during the postpartum period. The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which social determinants of health and allostatic load score, a 10-item index of biologic measures of chronic stress, predict psychological distress in low-income pregnant women over the first postpartum year. We conducted a secondary data analysis of the Child Community Health Research Network data set. The psychological distress outcome variables were perceived stress (n = 842), depression ( n = 845), and anxiety ( n = 846) symptoms, all measured categorically over the first year postpartum (T1:1 month, T2: 24-29 weeks, and T3: 50-65 weeks). Our predictors were social determinants of health (e.g., demographics, maternal hardship, percent poverty level, interpersonal violence, and food security) and allostatic load score. Generalized linear mixed models were used to determine which predictors were significantly associated with psychological distress symptoms across the first postpartum year. Interpersonal violence was a statistically significant risk factor for stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms over the first year postpartum. Other significant risk factors included low-income level, nativity, and perceived food security. Receiving food stamps was a significant protective factor for stress symptoms. The significance of risk factors for psychological distress, both modifiable and nonmodifiable, can be used as potential targets for further research, screening, and intervention. Future work should explore why and in what conditions these risk factors vary over time.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Material hardship represents a potential mechanism by which poverty influences the mental health of mothers. This study examined the association between two forms of material hardship, diaper need and food insufficiency, and maternal depressive symptoms. Methods: Data were from a cross-sectional study of 296 urban, pregnant or parenting, low-income women. A linear regression model was used to examine the association of maternal depressive symptoms, measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) score, with diaper need and food insufficiency, after adjustment for demographic factors. Results: More than half of women reported diaper need (50.3%) and food insufficiency (54.7%). Nearly one-third of women who reported diaper need did not report food insufficiency (32.2%). In bivariate analyses, diaper need and food insufficiency were associated with maternal CES-D score. In multivariate analyses, women who reported diaper need had a significantly higher CES-D score than women who did not report diaper need (β=3.5, p=0.03). Women who reported food insufficiency did not have a significantly higher CES-D score than women who did not report food insufficiency (β=2.4, p=0.15). Conclusions: Diaper need is a form of material hardship that has received little attention in the research literature. Diapers, unlike food, are currently not an allowable expense in U.S. antipoverty programs. Diaper need may contribute to maternal depressive symptoms, beyond the contribution of other forms of material hardship, because there are no supports in place to provide assistance meeting this basic need. Importantly, diaper need is a malleable factor amenable to public health and policy interventions.",

        "abstract": "Nearly a third of all U.S. workers, primarily lower-paid employees, do not have paid sick leave benefits, prompting some lawmakers to consider mandating paid sick leave for all U.S. employees so workers can access timely health care without lost wages. A representative sample of 19,537 workers in current paid employment was examined, searching for the association between access to paid sick leave benefits and receipt of six different welfare and welfare-related services. After controlling for relevant demographic, work, income, and medical/health care variables, results of the logistic models indicate that, among working adults age 18-64, those without paid sick leave are 1.41 times more likely to receive income from a state or county welfare program, 1.36 times more likely to receive other welfare assistance (transportation and child care supports), 1.33 times more likely to received sponsored rental assistance, and 1.34 times more likely to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (referred to as food stamps commonly and in this article). Mandating paid sick leave benefits may impact usage of social welfare assistance since families with paid sick leave do not have to lose wages when work is missed because of health and caregiver responsibilities.

We collected administrative data on enrollments and renewals processed through ELE methods from the 8 states.\n\n\nRESULTS\nELE was adopted in different ways; the method of adoption influenced how many children were served and administrative savings. Automatic ELE processes, which enable states to use eligibility findings from partner agencies to automatically enroll or renew children, serve the most children and generate, on average, $1 million annually in administrative savings. Given the size of renewal caseloads and the recurring nature of renewal, using ELE for renewals holds substantial promise for administrative savings and keeping children covered.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAutomatic ELE processes are a best practice for using ELE. However, because Congress has not yet made ELE a permanent policy option, states are discouraged from adopting this more efficient method of eligibility determination and redeterminations. Making ELE permanent would support states that have already adopted the policy; in addition, ELE could support the transition of children to Medicaid or exchanges should CHIP not be funded after September 30, 2015.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity affects 1 in 8 US households and has clear implications for population health disparities. We present a person-centered, multilevel framework for understanding how individuals living in food-insecure households cope with inadequate access to food themselves and within their households, communities, and broader food system. Many of these coping strategies can have an adverse impact on health, particularly when the coping strategies are sustained over time; others may be salutary for health. There exist multiple opportunities for aligning programs and policies so that they simultaneously support food security and improved diet quality in the interest of supporting improved health outcomes. Improved access to these programs and policies may reduce the need to rely on individual- and household-level strategies that may have negative implications for health across the life course.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine whether maternal depression predicts future household food insecurity for low-income families.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a secondary data analysis using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). The study cohort consisted of 2917 low-income mothers, defined as <185% federal poverty level, who were food secure at baseline. Maternal data collected when children were 9 and 24 months of age were used. Data at 9 months were considered baseline, and data at 24 months were considered follow-up. Baseline maternal depressive symptoms were measured by a 12-item abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Household food insecurity at follow-up was measured by the US Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt baseline, 16% of mothers were depressed (raw score >9). Most mothers were white, unemployed, and born in the United States. The majority received Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) (86%); 39% received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). At follow-up, 11.8% of mothers reported household food insecurity. In multivariable analysis, maternal depression at baseline was significantly associated with food insecurity at follow-up (adjusted odds ratio 1.50; 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.12).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that maternal depression is an independent risk factor for household food insecurity in low-income families with young children. Multidisciplinary interventions embedded within and outside the pediatric medical home should be developed to identify depressed mothers and link them to community-based mental health and food resources. Further longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to understand and address the complex relationship between poverty, maternal depression, social safety nets, and food insecurity.",

        "abstract": "Refundable tax credits and food assistance are the largest transfer programs available to able-bodied working poor and near-poor families in the United States, and simultaneous participation in these programs has more than doubled since the early 2000s. To understand this growth, we construct a series of two-year panels from the 1981–2013 waves of the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement to estimate the effect of state labor-market conditions, federal and state transfer program policy choices, and household demographics governing joint participation in food and refundable tax credit programs. Overall, changing policy drives much of the increase in the simultaneous, biennial use of food assistance and refundable tax credits. This stands in stark contrast from the factors accounting for the growth in food assistance alone, where cyclical and structural labor market factors account for at least one-half of the growth, and demographics play a more prominent role. Moreover, since 2000, the business cycle factors as the leading determinant in biennial participation decisions in food programs and refundable tax credits, suggesting a recent strengthening in the relationship between economic conditions and transfer programs.",

        "abstract": "Objective. The objective of this study was to identify benefits and barriers to using a farmers’ market (FM) incentive program among program participants. Design. In qualitative semistructured interviews, participants were asked about their experiences with shopping at FM, using FM incentives, barriers to fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake, and changes in dietary intake. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Inductive content analysis was used to code, categorize, and develop themes based on the transcriptions. Setting. A FM in Northern Utah. Subjects. A convenience sample of participants (n = 14) completed a 45- to 60-minute interview after receiving FM incentives for an 8-week intervention period. Results. FM incentives reduced barriers associated with shopping at FM such as cost and accessibility among program participants. Incentives provided participants with greater spending flexibility, allowing parents to provide children with F&V that previously did not fit into their food budget. Participants reported greater family and community involvement when shopping at FM. However, the limited hours and days of operation were factors that reduced the use of FM among participants, even when incentives were provided. Conclusions. The perceived benefits and barriers to shopping at FM and receiving FM incentives should be considered by future programmers and funding agencies.",

        "abstract": "Investing in strategies that aim to build a more nurturing society offers tremendous opportunities for the field of prevention science. Yet, scientists struggle to consistently take their research beyond effectiveness evaluations and actually value the impact of preventive strategies. Ultimately, it is clear that convincing policymakers to make meaningful investments in children and youth will require estimates of the fiscal impact of such strategies across public service systems. The framework offered here values such investments. First, we review current public spending on children and families. Then, we describe how to quantify and monetize the impact of preventive interventions. This includes a new measurement strategy for assessing multisystem service utilization and a price list for key service provision from public education, social services, criminal justice, health care and tax systems.",

        "abstract": "As the largest federal food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has potential to improve food choices among low-income populations. The program's impact on youth is important because they are represented in more than half of all SNAP households. This study estimates the impact of participation in SNAP, also known as the Food Stamp Program, on the frequency of soft drink, 100% fruit juice, and milk consumption among youth (ages 11 through 14) in the United States. A cohort of 3,126 youth from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey who were surveyed in 2004 (5th grade) and 2007 (8th grade) were used for the analysis. Multivariate linear regression with individual fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect of SNAP participation on the frequency of consumption of each beverage type in the preceding week. The fixed effects controlled for factors specific to the youth, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and time-invariant bias in reporting SNAP participation or beverage consumption. Overall participation in SNAP increased from 19.5% to 20.3% between 2004 and 2007, with 14.4% reporting a different participation status in 2007 as compared with 2004. SNAP participation was not found to be predictive of the frequency of soft drink, 100% fruit juice, or milk consumption among youth. In its current state, SNAP may serve to replace lost income for qualifying households, but not alter their food and beverage choices. Interventions that support access to and incentivize the consumption of more healthful foods and beverages may be successful in improving the nutritional quality of intake.",

        "abstract": "Health is shaped by both personal choices and features of the food environment. Food-choice decisions depend on complex interactions between biology and behavior, and are further modulated by the built environment and community structure. That lower-income families have lower-quality diets is well established. Yet, diet quality also varies across small geographic neighborhoods and can be influenced by transportation, retail, and ease of access to healthy foods, as well as by attitudes, beliefs, and social interactions. The learnings from the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS II) can be usefully applied to the much larger, more complex, and far more socially and ethnically diverse urban environment of New York City. The Kavli HUMAN Project (KHP) is ideally positioned to advance the understanding of health disparities by exploring the multiple underpinnings of food decision making. By combining geo-localized food shopping and consumption data with health behaviors, diet quality measures, and biomarkers, also coded by geographic location, the KHP will create the first-of-its-kind bio-behavioral, economic, and cultural atlas of diet quality and health for New York City.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to determine the influence of maternal health literacy and child’s age on participation in social welfare programs benefiting children. In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 560 Medicaid-eligible mother-infant dyads recruited in Philadelphia, maternal health literacy was assessed using the test of functional health literacy in adults (short version). Participation in social welfare programs [Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), child care subsidy, and public housing] was self-reported at child’s birth, and at the 6, 12, 18, 24 month follow-up interviews. Generalized estimating equations quantified the strength of maternal health literacy as an estimator of program participation. The mothers were primarily African-Americans (83 %), single (87 %), with multiple children (62 %). Nearly 24 % of the mothers had inadequate or marginal health literacy. Children whose mothers had inadequate health literacy were less likely to receive child care subsidy (adjusted OR = 0.54, 95 % CI 0.34–0.85) than children whose mothers had adequate health literacy. Health literacy was not a significant predictor for TANF, SNAP, WIC or housing assistance. The predicted probability for participation in all programs decreased from birth to 24 months. Most notably, predicted WIC participation declined rapidly after age one. During the first 24 months, mothers with inadequate health literacy could benefit from simplified or facilitated child care subsidy application processes. Targeted outreach and enrollment efforts conducted by social welfare programs need to take into account the changing needs of families as children age.",

        "abstract": "Criminal convictions are often associated with collateral consequences that limit access to the forms of employment and social services on which disadvantaged women most frequently rely--regardless of the severity of the offense. These consequences may play an important role in perpetuating health disparities by socioeconomic status and gender. We examined the extent to which research studies to date have assessed whether a criminal conviction might influence women's health by limiting access to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and employment, as a secondary, or \"collateral\" criminal conviction-related consequence. We reviewed 434 peer-reviewed journal articles retrieved from three electronic article databases and 197 research reports from three research organizations. Two reviewers independently extracted data from each eligible article or report using a standardized coding scheme. Of the sixteen eligible studies included in the review, most were descriptive. None explored whether receiving TANF modified health outcomes, despite its potential to do so. Researchers to date have not fully examined the causal pathways that could link employment, receiving TANF, and health, especially for disadvantaged women. Future research is needed to address this gap and to understand better the potential consequences of the criminal justice system involvement on the health of this vulnerable population.",

A committee convened by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) examined the question of whether it is feasible to define SNAP allotment adequacy. Total resources; individual, household, and environmental factors; and SNAP program characteristics that affect allotment adequacy were identified from a framework developed by the IOM committee. The committee concluded that it is feasible to define SNAP allotment adequacy; however, such a definition must take into account the degree to which participants' total resources and individual, household, and environmental factors influence the purchasing power of SNAP benefits and the impact of SNAP program characteristics on the calculation of the dollar value of the SNAP allotment. The committee recommended that the USDA Food and Nutrition Service investigate ways to incorporate these factors and program characteristics into research aimed at defining allotment adequacy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides nutrition assistance benefits to low-income families in an effort to reduce hunger and improve health and well-being. Because 1 in 7 Americans participate in the program each month, policymakers need to know whether the program is meeting these objectives effectively.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to estimate the association between SNAP participation and household food security using recent data from the largest national survey of the food security of SNAP participants to date.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe analysis used a survey of nearly 6500 households and a quasi-experimental research design that consisted of 2 sets of comparisons. Using a cross-sectional sample, we compared information collected from SNAP households within days of program entry with information collected from a contemporaneous sample of SNAP households that had participated for ∼6 mo. Next, using a longitudinal sample, we compared baseline information collected from new-entrant SNAP households with information from those same households 6 mo later. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate associations between SNAP and household food security.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSNAP participation decreased the percentage of SNAP households that were food insecure in both samples by 6-17%. SNAP participation also decreased the percentage of households experiencing severe food insecurity--designated very low food security--by 12-19%. Findings were qualitatively robust to different empirical specifications.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSNAP serves a vital role in improving the health and well-being of households by increasing food security. Given recent legislation to reduce program size and limit program eligibility, this study underscores SNAP's continued importance in affecting households' well-being. Future research is needed to determine whether specific groups of households experience differential improvements in food security.",

        "abstract": "In this review, we examine the effects of family economic security policies (i.e., minimum wage, earned income tax credit, unemployment insurance, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) on child and family health outcomes, summarize policy generosity across states in the USA, and discuss directions and possibilities for future research. This manuscript is an update to a review article that was published in 2014. Millions of Americans are affected by family economic security policies each year, many of whom are the most vulnerable in society. There is increasing evidence that these policies impact health outcomes and behaviors of adults and children. Further, research indicates that, overall, policies which are more restrictive are associated with poorer health behaviors and outcomes; however, the strength of the evidence differs across each of the four policies. There is significant diversity in state-level policies, and it is plausible that these policy variations are contributing to health disparities across and within states. Despite increasing evidence of the relationship between economic policies and health, there continues to be limited attention to this issue. State policy variations offer a valuable opportunity for scientists to conduct natural experiments and contribute to evidence linking social policy effects to family and child well-being. The mounting evidence will help to guide future research and policy making for evolving toward a more nurturing society for family and child health and well-being.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine Internet access and interest in receiving nutrition education via social media applications among low‐income adults participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP‐Ed). Methods: A cross‐sectional survey was distributed during 25 SNAP‐Ed classes throughout the 16 southernmost counties of Illinois. Results: From 188 responses, the majority of participants had Internet access (76%). Among participants aged 18–32 years (n = 51), 92% owned a smartphone with Internet access and 57% indicated that they would use online nutrition education, with most interest in e‐mail (41%), Facebook (40%), and text messaging (35%). There was little interest in using blogs, Vine, Twitter, Tumblr, and Pinterest. Overall, 49% of middle‐aged adults aged 33–64 years and 87% of seniors aged ≥65 years reported they would not use online nutrition education. Conclusions and Implications: Results indicated similar Internet accessibility in southern Illinois among low‐income populations compared with national rural rates. Interest in using online nutrition education varied among SNAP‐Ed participants according to age. Young adults appeared to be the most captive audience regarding online nutrition education. Results may be useful to agencies implementing SNAP‐Ed to supplement current curriculum with online nutrition education for audiences aged ≤32 years.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundFamilies with children under age six participating in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF) must participate in work-related activities for 20 h per week. However, due to financial hardship, poor health, and exposure to violence and adversity, families may experience great difficulty in reaching self-sufficiency. The purpose of this report is to describe study design and baseline findings of a trauma-informed financial empowerment and peer support intervention meant to mitigate these hardships.MethodsWe conducted a randomized controlled trial of a 28-week intervention called Building Wealth and Health Network to improve financial security and maternal and child health among caregivers participating in TANF. Participants, recruited from County Assistance offices in Philadelphia, PA, were randomized into two intervention groups (partial and full) and one control group. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline to assess career readiness, economic hardship, health and wellbeing, exposure to adversity and violence, and interaction with criminal justice systems.ResultsBaseline characteristics demonstrate that among 103 participants, there were no significant differences by group. Mean age of participants was 25 years, and youngest child was 30 months. The majority of participants were women (94.2 %), never married (83.5 %), unemployed (94.2 %), and without a bank account (66.0 %). Many reported economic hardship (32.0 % very low household food secure, 65.0 % housing insecure, and 31.1 % severe energy insecure), and depression (57.3 %). Exposure to adversity was prevalent, where 38.8 % reported four or more Adverse Childhood Experiences including abuse, neglect and household dysfunction. In terms of community violence, 64.7 % saw a seriously wounded person after an incident of violence, and 27.2 % had seen someone killed. Finally, 14.6 % spent time in an adult correctional institution, and 48.5 % of the fathers of the youngest child spent time in prison.ConclusionsBaseline findings demonstrate that caregivers participating in TANF have suffered significant childhood adversity, adult violence exposure, and poverty-related stressors that can limit workforce success. High prevalence of housing and food insecurity, exposure to adversity, violence and criminal justice systems demands comprehensive programming to support families. Trauma-informed approaches to career readiness such as the Building Wealth and Health Network offer opportunities for potential success in the workforce.Trial registrationThis study is retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.govThe Identifier is: NCT02577705\n The Registration date is October 13, 2015",

        "abstract": "This paper examines whether a chilling effect of restrictive state laws aimed at immigrants creates a barrier to enrollment in the food stamp program (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) for U.S. citizen children in low-income immigrant families. This analysis looks at 20 states in the continental United States from 2000 to 2008 that were either at or above the U.S. average for percentage of foreign-born population, or states that ranked in the top 10 percent in terms of change in foreign-born population for that time period. To examine this issue, a multivariate, regression-based difference-in-differences (DD) analysis was applied. The \"treatment\" group is immigrant families with a U.S. citizen child that is 130% of the federal poverty level or below in states with restrictive immigrant related legislation and the \"control\" group is native families meeting the same federal poverty level guidelines as well as low-income immigrant families in states without the restrictive legislation. The research findings show that there does not appear to be a chilling effect associated with restrictive state laws on participation in the food stamp program. Food insecurity is an immediate need that may override the impediments to enrollment due to immigration status, causing families to apply despite a negative climate toward immigrants. For policy makers and immigrant advocates it is important to know where chilling effects might not occur in order to work with politicians and federal agencies on crafting sound evidence-based policy. Independent of any chilling effect, the model shows that immigrant families are less likely to enroll in food stamp benefits, consistent with other literature. In addition, independent of the effects of restrictive immigration legislation, both non-citizen and naturalized mothers were less likely to be in a family with food stamp benefits compared to similar native-born mothers. This indicates that all states have a gap in food stamp program enrollment that merits further attention and research.",

        "abstract": "Almost fifty million people are food insecure in the United States, which makes food insecurity one of the nation's leading health and nutrition issues. We examine recent research evidence of the health consequences of food insecurity for children, nonsenior adults, and seniors in the United States. For context, we first provide an overview of how food insecurity is measured in the country, followed by a presentation of recent trends in the prevalence of food insecurity. Then we present a survey of selected recent research that examined the association between food insecurity and health outcomes. We show that the literature has consistently found food insecurity to be negatively associated with health. For example, after confounding risk factors were controlled for, studies found that food-insecure children are at least twice as likely to report being in fair or poor health and at least 1.4 times more likely to have asthma, compared to food-secure children; and food-insecure seniors have limitations in activities of daily living comparable to those of food-secure seniors fourteen years older. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) substantially reduces the prevalence of food insecurity and thus is critical to reducing negative health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "This research aimed to identify perceived barriers and facilitators of farm-to-consumer (FTC) retail outlet (eg, farmers' markets, farm/roadside stands) usage among Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participants residing in Birmingham, Alabama. Additionally, associations between barriers and facilitators reported and daily fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake were examined. A sample of 312 lower income women (mean age = 27.6; 67.0% non-Hispanic black; 45.3% obese) who participate in the Birmingham WIC program were surveyed between October 2014 and January 2015. Fischer's exact test was used to assess associations between barriers (eg, outlet location, price, transportation), facilitators (eg, produce quality, produce variety), and high F&V intake (ie, consuming ≥ 5 servings per day). Approximately 81 (26.1%) participants reported using an FTC outlet to purchase produce in 2014. Lack of awareness (39.3%), outlet location (32.8%), and lack of interest (28.4%) were the barriers most often reported. Produce quality (69.1%), produce variety (49.4%), and price (39.5%) were the facilitators most often reported. Barriers and facilitators mentioned were not associated with high F&V intake. Lack of awareness and lack of interest are key barriers to FTC outlet usage among Birmingham WIC recipients. Interventions aiming to promote use of FTC outlets should consider the perceived barriers and facilitators to usage.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFood insecurity, and particularly rural food insecurity, has unique challenges associated with it. Understanding the customer or patron needs is increasingly important in resolving this national concern. The Jobs to Be Done Theory posits that when considering customers, it is beneficial to move past demographic profiling and focus on what the customer wants to accomplish by using a particular product or service.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis qualitative study aimed to determine customers' jobs to be done at a rural food pantry. In addition, it seeks to demonstrate the application of contemporary management theory to dietetics practice.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA case study approach was used in this study. Case study data collection procedures included six male and six female food pantry patrons in Montana completing in-depth, audio-recorded interviews and surveys. Each person's interview and survey were constructed into individual case descriptions; the case descriptions were analyzed using uniform categories determined by researchers. To identify themes in the holistic case, word tables were created for each uniform category and assessed for key themes representing patrons' experiences.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe key themes that emerged were the customer in context, customers' food relief needs, connecting with customers, and barriers to utilization.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe application of Jobs to Be Done Theory to rural food pantry customers demonstrates that demographic segmentation does not capture the social, emotional, and functional dimensions for this sample. Investigation of customer experiences, circumstances, and obstacles is important for improving dietetics services.",

        "abstract": "Although research consistently points to higher rates of food insecurity (FI) among children of immigrants (COI), this is the first study to examine longitudinal trajectories of FI for this group. We used growth curve modeling and data from the 1998 Early Childhood Longitudinal Study—Kindergarten Cohort to compare trajectories of FI for COI and children of U.S.-born parents. After controlling for socioeconomic status and participation in nutrition programs, first- and second-generation COI had significantly higher initial and ongoing rates of FI compared to children of U.S.-born parents. Additional analyses found that all differences between COI and children of U.S.-born parents occurred for families in poverty. We find that COI from poor families have higher rates of FI, with some differences among COI by immigrant generation. Policymakers may need to focus on avenues other than public assistance to reduce FI among COI living in poverty.",

        "abstract": "Two of the primary programs through which the federal government provides benefits to low income families are the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program and the Food Stamp program. However, many eligible low income families do not actually receive these benefits. We combined state-level policy data with rich data on a national sample of low income families to investigate family and state-level predictors of TANF and Food Stamp receipt. Our findings indicate: 1) families experiencing more economic hardship and health challenges are more likely to receive benefits, and 2) states' coverage is associated with families' receipt of TANF, but not Food Stamps. Implications for policy and research are discussed.",

Effectiveness and cost of Facebook to recruit low-income women to an online nutrition program were examined, including biopsychosocial characteristics of Facebook responders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn ad appeared on the Facebook page of low-income women, 18-45 years old, living in Pennsylvania to invite access to an online nutrition program. Eligible persons completed surveys about food-related behaviors including eating competence, food security, and assistance program use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 465 people who clicked on the ad, 81 completed the eligibility survey, and 62 were eligible; 52 completed a preprogram survey. Completers were mostly white (79%), overweight/obese (mean body mass index 36.2 ± 12.9), and not eating competent (75%). Low-income status was identified for 75% (n = 39) of completers. Total recruitment cost over 19 days was $596.71.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nFacebook appears to be an effective tool to recruit low-income women to nutrition education projects.",

        "abstract": "The United States is facing two interconnected social and public health crises of severe obesity and food insecurity within the social-ecological environment. Marginalized groups experience the highest rates and the greatest impacts in terms of morbidity, mortality, and financial burdens. Consequences include experiencing multimorbidities, mental health issues, and decreased quality of life. Food pantries have served as spaces to obtain food to meet household needs, but for some, food pantries have become long-term solutions. We surveyed 2,634 people who accessed pantries in 2005, 2010, and 2013 across 32 counties in a Midwest state. The authors sought to understand to what extent does length of time using a food pantry, food security status, income sources, use of federal food benefits, visiting a doctor, and demographic variables increase odds of severe obesity. More than 14% were severely obese; those who were long-term food pantry users and very low food secure were 1.732 times more likely to be severely obese. Receiving Disability/Supplemental Security Income, seeing a doctor in the last year, being female, and older age reduced the odds of severe obesity. Discussion includes implications for social workers who interact with groups likely to experience very low food security and severe obesity at different systems levels.",

We used cross-sectional data from 295 adults living in Baltimore, USA. HMP was inversely associated with FFS, which had lower odds of HMP ≥1 time/day and higher BMI scores. HMP was positively associated with positive beliefs and self-efficacy toward healthy foods, getting food from healthier food sources, and lower FFS. Higher odds of HMP ≥1 time/day were associated with getting food from farmers' market and supermarkets or grocery stores. FFS had an inverse association with positive beliefs and self-efficacy toward healthy foods, and a positive association with less healthy food acquisition scores. Higher odds of FFS ≥1 time/week were associated with getting food from corner stores, sit-down restaurants, and convenience stores.",

We utilize a Rasch measurement model to identify thresholds of very low food security among households and very low food security among children in the Three City Study that are comparable to thresholds from the HFSSM. We also use the Three City Study to empirically investigate the determinants of food insecurity and of these specific food insecurity outcomes, estimating a multivariate behavioral Rasch model that is adapted to address longitudinal data. The estimation results indicate that participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program reduce food insecurity, while poverty and disability among caregivers increase it. Besides its longitudinal structure, the Three City Study measures many more characteristics about households than the CPS. Our estimates reveal that financial assistance through social networks and a household's own financial assets reduce food insecurity, while its outstanding loans increase insecurity.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundDiet quality among federal food assistance program participants remains low, and little research has assessed the diet quality of food insecure non-participants. Further research is needed to assess the extent to which food substitutions can improve the nutritional status of these vulnerable populations. Substituting egg dishes for other commonly consumed dishes at certain eating occasions may be an effective strategy for improving the daily nutrient intake among these groups. Eggs are rich in many important nutrients, and are low-cost and part of a wide range of cultural food menus, which are important considerations for low-income and ethnically diverse populations. To help guide the focus of targeted nutrition interventions and education campaigns for vulnerable populations, the present work begins by 1) estimating the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy among these groups, and then models the effect of consuming egg dishes instead of commonly consumed dishes at each eating occasion on 2) the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy, and 3) the mean intake of nutrients.MethodsDietary data from 34,741 adults ≥ 20 y were acquired from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001–2014. Diet pattern modeling was used to substitute commonly consumed egg dishes for commonly consumed main dishes at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. National Cancer Institute usual intake methods were used to estimate the prevalence of inadequate intake of 31 nutrients pre- and post-substitution, and a novel index was used to estimate change in intake of all nutrients collectively.ResultsSubstituting eggs for commonly consumed main dishes at lunch or dinner did not change total daily nutrient intake for each group (P > 0.05), but decreased the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy by 1–4 percentage points (P < 0.01). Substituting eggs for commonly consumed foods at breakfast increased the prevalence of folate inadequacy by 8–12 percentage points among each group (P < 0.01).ConclusionsWhen making food substitutions to increase nutrient intake, eating occasion should be an important consideration. Further research is needed to better understand how food substitutions affect diet costs, which may be an important driver of food purchasing decisions among low income individuals with limited food budgets.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe estimated associations between experiencing a home foreclosure filing and experiencing a child protective services (CPS) investigation or substantiation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe linked a large sample drawn from administrative data on foreclosure filings, CPS involvement, and participation in a host of other public programs for >60,000 Wisconsin households over a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011. Our empirical analyses used piecewise exponential survival models to estimate the risk of CPS involvement (investigation or substantiation) as a function of a home foreclosure filing and a set of individual and household characteristics. We fitted these models with and without the inclusion of propensity score weights.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHouseholds that experienced a foreclosure filing had a much higher probability of CPS involvement. This was true in the year before the filing as well as the year after the foreclosure filing. However, these associations were generally largest in the period before or shortly afterward.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExperiencing a foreclosure filing is associated with increased CPS involvement. However, it is not clear that this association is driven by the foreclosure filing action itself. Rather, increased risk of CPS involvement is apparent during the process of moving toward the filing as well as the year or so after the filing, both of which are likely characterized by limited economic resources as well as by financial and other stress.",

This study compared the cross-sector involvement of Medicaid expansion enrollees who were high health care utilizers to that of other expansion enrollees in Hennepin County, Minnesota. We examined forty-six months of annualized utilization and cost data for expansion-eligible residents with at least twelve months of enrollment (N = 70,134) across health care, housing, criminal justice, and human service sectors. High health care utilizers, approximately 7 percent of our sample, were disproportionately American Indian, younger, and significantly more likely than other expansion enrollees to have mental health (88.1 percent versus 48.0 percent) or substance use diagnoses (79.2 percent versus 29.6 percent). Total cross-sector public spending was nearly four times higher for high health care users ($25,337 versus $6,786), and their non-health care expenses were 2.4 times higher ($7,476 versus $3,108). High levels of cross-sector service use suggest that there are opportunities for collaboration that may result in cost savings across sectors.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Children in immigrant families (CIF) are at elevated risk of experiencing adverse social determinants of health (SDH), particularly material hardship, which contribute to disparate health outcomes. Previous studies have found that SDH screening programs integrated into pediatric practices have increased receipt of social service resources. Few studies have examined use of social services in these programs among ethnically-diverse patient populations and associations with caregiver immigrant status or limited English proficiency (LEP). Methods: Caregivers of children (<18 years) were routinely screened in a practice-based, SDH screening program offering referral, assisted navigation and follow-up support. Information on caregiver race/ethnicity, US nativity, citizenship status and self-reported English proficiency was collected. Associations with utilization of referral resources at 12 weeks were measured using Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests. Results: Of 148 caregivers, most were mothers (83.2%) and non-White (91.9%). Over half were born outside of the U.S (59.7%) and one-third were LEP (33.6%). Approximately one-third (30.9%) successfully utilized program-provided resources at 12-week follow-up. LEP caregivers and undocumented caregivers were more likely to be lost-to-follow-up. However, LEP caregivers who remained in the program utilized resources more than English-proficient caregivers (38.4 vs. 18.4%, p = 0.031). Similarly, significantly more non-citizen caregivers utilized referrals compared to US citizens (37.4 vs. 23.1 vs. 0.0%, p = 0.043). Conclusions: Families with non-US citizen or LEP caregivers were at highest risk of being lost-to-follow-up, but if engaged, were more likely to utilize resources. These findings indicate the need for larger studies to determine how to prevent loss-to-follow-up among immigrant and LEP caregivers participating in SDH screening programs.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nFew studies have assessed how people's perceptions of their neighborhood environment compare with objective measures or how self-reported and objective neighborhood measures relate to consumption of fruits and vegetables.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA telephone survey of 4,399 residents of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, provided data on individuals, their households, their neighborhoods (self-defined), their food-environment perceptions, and their fruit-and-vegetable consumption. Other data on neighborhoods (census tracts) or \"extended neighborhoods\" (census tracts plus 1-quarter-mile buffers) came from the US Census Bureau, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, and the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Mixed-effects multilevel logistic regression models examined associations between food-environment perceptions, fruit-and-vegetable consumption, and individual, household, and neighborhood characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPerceptions of neighborhood food environments (supermarket accessibility, produce availability, and grocery quality) were strongly associated with each other but not consistently or significantly associated with objective neighborhood measures or self-reported fruit-and-vegetable consumption. We found racial and educational disparities in fruit-and-vegetable consumption, even after adjusting for food-environment perceptions and individual, household, and neighborhood characteristics. Having a supermarket in the extended neighborhood was associated with better perceived supermarket access (adjusted odds ratio for having a conventional supermarket, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.68-2.46]; adjusted odds ratio for having a limited-assortment supermarket, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.02-1.59]) but not increased fruit-and-vegetable consumption. Models showed some counterintuitive associations with neighborhood crime and public transportation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe found limited association between objective and self-reported neighborhood measures. Sociodemographic differences in individual fruit-and-vegetable consumption were evident regardless of neighborhood environment. Adding supermarkets to urban neighborhoods might improve residents' perceptions of supermarket accessibility but might not increase their fruit-and-vegetable consumption.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nObesity is the leading preventable cause of illness and a major contributor to chronic disease. Eating fresh fruits and vegetables can help manage and prevent weight gain and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Low-income communities often lack stores that sell fresh fruit and vegetables and have instead stores that sell foods low in nutritional value. The objective of this study was to understand perceived community-level barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption among low-income people.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted 8 focus groups involving 68 low-income participants in 2 North Carolina counties, from May 2011 through August 2011. The socioecological model of health guided data analysis, and 2 trained researchers coded transcripts and summarized findings. Four focus groups were conducted in each county; 1 was all male, 5 all female, and 2 mixed sexes. Most participants were black (68%), most were women (69.1%), and most had a high school education or less (61.8%). Almost half received support from either the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or another government assistance program.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 6 major community-level barriers to access to fruits and vegetables: cost, transportation, quality, variety, changing food environment, and changing societal norms on food.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPolicymakers should consider supporting programs that decrease the cost and increase the supply of high-quality fruits and vegetables in low-income communities.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that children and adolescents should have access to safe and healthy foods that promote physical, cognitive, and social growth and development. Federally funded nutrition assistance programs, such as food assistance, meal service, and nutrition education, play a vital role in ensuring that children and adolescents have access to the foods they need and in improving the overall nutrition and health environments of communities. Federally funded nutrition assistance programs help to ensure that children and adolescents receive safe, healthy foods that provide adequate energy and nutrients to meet their growth and development needs. These programs provide access to adequate food supplies to combat hunger and food insecurity; provide healthy foods to children and adolescents who have nutritional or medical risk factors, such as iron deficiency anemia; and provide nutrition education. In addition, federally funded nutrition assistance programs serve as a means to prevent or reduce obesity and other chronic diseases. It is important that permanent and full federal funding be provided for these programs, which have been consistently shown to have a positive impact on child and adolescent nutrition and health outcomes. Registered dietitian nutritionists and nutrition and dietetic technicians, registered-trained in food science, nutrition, and food systems to implement programs to monitor, evaluate, and improve the nutritional status of children and adolescents-are preeminently qualified to implement and evaluate nutrition assistance programs for children and adolescents.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundPoorer diets and subsequent higher rates of chronic disease among lower-income individuals may be partially attributed to reduced access to fresh fruits and vegetables (F&V) and other healthy foods. Mobile markets are an increasingly popular method for providing access to F&V in underserved communities, but evaluation efforts are limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of Veggie Van (VV), a mobile produce market, on F&V intake in lower-income communities using a group randomized controlled trial.MethodsVV is a mobile produce market that sells reduced-cost locally grown produce and offers nutrition and cooking education. We recruited 12 sites in lower-income communities in North Carolina (USA) to host VV, randomizing them to receive VV immediately (intervention) or after the 6-month study period (delayed intervention control). Participants at each site completed baseline and follow-up surveys including F&V intake, perceived access to fresh F&V and self-efficacy for purchasing, preparing and eating F&V. We used multiple linear regression to calculate adjusted differences in outcomes while controlling for baseline values, education and clustering within site.ResultsAmong 142 participants who completed the follow-up, baseline F&V intake was 3.48 cups/day for control and 3.33 for intervention. At follow-up, adjusted change in F&V consumption was 0.95 cups/day greater for intervention participants (p = 0.005), but was attenuated to 0.51 cups per day (p = 0.11) after removing extreme values. VV customers increased their F&V consumption by 0.41 cups/day (n = 30) compared to a 0.25 cups/day decrease for 111 non-customers (p = 0.04). Intervention participants did not show significant improvements in perceived access to fresh F&V, but increased their self-efficacy for working more F&V into snacks (p = 0.02), making up a vegetable dish with what they had on hand (p = 0.03), and cooking vegetables in a way that is appealing to their family (p = 0.048).ConclusionsMobile markets may help improve F&V intake in lower-income communities.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov ID# NCT03026608 retrospectively registered January 2, 2017.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate how 3 forms of housing instability relate to caregiver and child health among low-income renter households.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCaregivers of children 0 to 48 months of age were interviewed in 5 urban medical centers from May 2009 to December 2015. Caregivers reported on the following: caregiver health, maternal depressive symptoms, child's health, lifetime hospitalizations, developmental risk, and 3 housing circumstances, which were categorized as being behind on rent in the past 12 months, multiple moves (≥ 2 in past 12 months), and child's lifetime history of homelessness. Associations with caregiver and child health outcomes were examined through multivariable logistic regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 22 324 families, 34% had at least 1 of the following adverse housing circumstances: 27% had been behind on rent, 8% had made multiple moves, and 12% had a history of being homeless. Overlap between these was limited; 86% experienced only 1 adverse housing circumstance. Each circumstance was individually associated with increased adjusted odds of adverse health and material hardship compared with stable housing. Households behind on rent had increased adjusted odds of fair and/or poor caregiver health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.77-2.05), maternal depressive symptoms (aOR: 2.71; 95% CI: 2.51-2.93), child lifetime hospitalizations (aOR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.10-1.27), fair and/or poor child health (aOR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.28-1.56), and household material hardships. Families with multiple moves and history of homelessness had similar adverse caregiver, child, health, and hardship outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThree forms of housing instability were associated with adverse caregiver and child health among low-income renter households. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends social screening within health care; providers could consider assessing for behind on rent, multiple moves, and homelessness in high-risk practices.",

        "abstract": "Objective To develop and test an observational survey that quantifies food pantry environments (FPE). Design Best practices in FPE were identified through key informant interviews. The tool was pilot‐tested, including a content review, and then field‐tested for reliability. Setting Key informant phone interviews (n = 41); pilot and field test visits occurred at 45 pantries from multiple states. Subjects Food bank/pantry staff and nutrition educators were recruited for interviews through purposive and snowball sampling. Pilot and field test survey users (n = 65) were food pantry representatives and matched community partners who both rated the FPE using the tool. Variables Measured Pearson correlation was used to determine test‐retest and interrater reliability. Analysis Qualitative data were coded for healthy FPE strategies. Quantitative data were calculated using descriptive statistics (significant at P < .05). Results Qualitative data were coded for observable FPE characteristics. Reliability scores were substantial to nearly perfect for 48 of 61 survey items (79%) for test‐retest and 49 of 61 (80%) for interrater reliability (Pearson r = .6–1.0). Conclusions and Implications The Healthy Food Pantry Assessment Tool is research‐tested and can be used to evaluate and quantify the healthfulness of FPE.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis is the first peer-reviewed study to quantify diaper need, propose a method to measure diaper need, and explore psychosocial variables associated with diaper need in a large sample of urban, low-income families.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were derived from a cross-sectional study in 877 pregnant and parenting women. Mothers completed surveys on topics related to mental health, basic needs, and health care use. Logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between diaper need and psychosocial correlates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlmost 30% of mothers reported diaper need. Hispanic women were significantly more likely to report diaper need than African American women (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-3.33), and women ≥ 45 years of age were significantly more likely than women between the ages of 20 and 44 years to report diaper need (OR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.21-5.28). Women who reported mental health need were significantly more likely than women who did not report mental health need to report diaper need (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.16-3.09).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough a majority of studies have examined family socioeconomic status as income and educational and employment status, emerging research suggests that indicators of material hardship are increasingly important to child health. This study supports this premise with the suggestion that an adequate supply of diapers may prove a tangible way of reducing parenting stress, a critical factor influencing child health and development. There is potential for pediatric providers to inquire about diaper need and refer families to a local diaper distribution service as 1 method to reduce parenting stress.",

Tobacco use disproportionately affects members of vulnerable populations, and by acting on multiple socioecological levels, serves to perpetuate and reinforce cycles of poverty. Members of the pediatric medical community can play a key role in interrupting cycles of tobacco use. Providers can serve as powerful allies to vulnerable communities by treating tobacco use in caregivers, counseling youth against using tobacco products, protecting children from the impact of secondhand smoke exposure, and advocating for economic, social, and health policies to disrupt intergenerational smoking.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn 2009, the USDA implemented an interim rule that changed the prescribed foods in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Options for mother and infant dyads include a full breastfeeding package with no infant formula, a partial breastfeeding package with some infant formula, and a full formula package with a smaller postpartum food package for the mother. The changes were designed to encourage WIC mothers to choose breastfeeding for their infants.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe purpose of this study was to measure changes in the following 3 outcomes: WIC food-package assignments, WIC infant formula amounts, and breastfeeding initiation.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe compared outcomes before and after implementation of the interim rule in a national random sample of 17 local WIC agencies (LWAs). The data source was administrative records for 206,092 dyads with an infant aged 0-5 mo in the sampled LWAs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were changes in WIC food-package assignments and infant formula amounts but no change in breastfeeding initiation. For dyads in whom the infant was in his or her birth month, the percentage of mothers who received the partial breastfeeding package fell from 24.7% (preimplementation) to 13.8% (postimplementation), the percentage of mothers who received the full breastfeeding package rose from 9.8% (preimplementation) to 17.1% (postimplementation), and the percentage of mothers who received the full formula package rose from 20.5% (preimplementation) to 28.5% (postimplementation).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter the change, fewer WIC mothers of new infants received the partial breastfeeding package. More WIC mothers received the full breastfeeding package, but more mothers also received the full formula package.",

        "abstract": "We studied the health of low-income US women affected by the largest social policy change in recent US history: the 1996 welfare reforms. Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1993-2012), we performed 2 types of analysis. First, we used difference-in-difference-in-differences analyses to estimate associations between welfare reforms and health outcomes among the most affected women (single mothers aged 18-64 years in 1997; n = 219,469) compared with less affected women (married mothers, single nonmothers, and married nonmothers of the same age range in 1997; n = 2,422,265). We also used a synthetic control approach in which we constructed a more ideal control group for single mothers by weighting outcomes among the less affected groups to match pre-reform outcomes among single mothers. In both specifications, the group most affected by welfare reforms (single mothers) experienced worse health outcomes than comparison groups less affected by the reforms. For example, the reforms were associated with at least a 4.0-percentage-point increase in binge drinking (95% confidence interval: 0.9, 7.0) and a 2.4-percentage-point decrease in the probability of being able to afford medical care (95% confidence interval: 0.1, 4.8) after controlling for age, educational level, and health care insurance status. Although the reforms were applauded for reducing welfare dependency, they may have adversely affected health.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity has been a persistent problem in the U.S., and yet over the past three decades, federally funded food programs have become more restrictive. Scholars and policymakers have inquired whether the nonprofit sector is increasing its food provision activities to address this unmet need. This study analyzes data from the U.S. Census and a nationally representative survey of religious congregations in the U.S. to examine trends in food insecurity and congregation-based food provision between 1998 and 2012. The objective of the study is to investigate the extent to which congregation-based food provision fluctuated with national food insecurity prevalence for the overall population, and for subgroups vulnerable to this condition. Results show an over-time correspondence between the prevalence of food-insecure households and the prevalence of congregations that provide food. Parallel patterns are observed between food insecurity in disproportionately affected subpopulations (e.g., African-Americans and immigrants) and food provision in the congregations likely to serve those households. These findings indicate that congregations are helping meet the needs of food-insecure households. However, research suggests that congregations and nonprofits are not an adequate substitute for federally funded programs. Policy recommendations include expanding access to federally funded programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to more immigrants and other groups vulnerable to food insecurity, as well as providing more systematic financial or federal support and quality control of congregation-based efforts.",

        "abstract": "Participation in women, infants and children (WIC), supplemental nutritional assistance program (SNAP), temporary assistance for needy families (TANF), and medical assistance program (MAP) programs provide critical nutrition and health benefits to low-income families. Concurrent enrollment in these programs provides a powerful safety net, yet simultaneous participation is reported to be low. Underutilization undermines program objectives, client well-being and food security. This paper examines concurrent participation among the most needy WIC clients, those at/below 100 % of the federal poverty level (FPL), in SNAP, TANF and MAP. We examined the Maryland state WIC program infant electronic database (N = 34,409) for the 12-month period ending September 2010. Our analysis focused on two-thirds of these infants (N = 23,065) who were at/below the 100 % FPL. Mothers’ mean age was 26.8 ± 6 years; 20.6 % White; 52.7 % African American, and 23.4 % Hispanic. Approximately 10 % of infants weighed <2,500 g and 1.5 % weighed <1,500 g at birth. Average household income was $10,160; 55.7 % were at/below 50 % FPL. Two-thirds (68.4 %) participated in MAP, 31 % in SNAP and 9 % in TANF. Only 8 % were enrolled in all three programs whereas 28 % were not enrolled in any. There was a statistically significant difference in mean age and household income between multi-program beneficiaries and mothers who solely participated in WIC: 25.6 ± 5 years and $7,298 ± $4,496 compared with 27.2 ± 6 years and $12,216 ± $6,920, respectively (p < 0.001). Among WIC families at or below 100 % FPL, only 8 % received multi-program benefits. Specific factors responsible for participation on an individual level are not available. To optimize enrollment, a coordinated effort is essential to identify and overcome barriers to concurrent participation among these families.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo estimate the impact of Express Lane Eligible (ELE) implementation on Medicaid/CHIP enrollment in eight states.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING\n2007 to 2011 data from the Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS) on Medicaid/CHIP enrollment.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nWe estimate difference-in-difference equations, with quarter and state fixed effects. The key independent variable is an indicator for whether the state had ELE in place in the given quarter, allowing the experience of statistically matched non-ELE states to serve as a formal counterfactual against which to assess the changes in the eight ELE states. The model also controls for time-varying economic and policy factors within each state.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS\nWe obtained SEDS enrollment data from CMS.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nAcross model specifications, the ELE effects on Medicaid enrollment among children were consistently positive, ranging between 4.0 and 7.3 percent, with most estimates statistically significant at the 5 percent level. We also find that ELE increased combined Medicaid/CHIP enrollment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results imply that ELE has been an effective way for states to increase enrollment and retention among children eligible for Medicaid/CHIP. These results also imply that ELE-like policies could improve take-up of subsidized coverage under the ACA.",

We used a two-step estimation approach, examining the likelihood of utilization and then the volume and cost of services among users. Regression adjustment corrected for demographic differences.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nMost ELE and comparison group children used services within a year of enrollment and accessed a variety of services, including outpatient care, prescription drugs, and dental and vision care. ELE enrollees were somewhat less likely to use each service type, and those who used services often did so less intensively compared to other enrollees in their state.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHealth care use patterns suggest that ELE enrollees are aware of their coverage; enrollees accessed and repeatedly used services covered by public health insurance. However, states considering this policy may expect that remaining eligible but uninsured children may be less expensive to cover than existing beneficiaries.",

Supermarkets and ethnic markets were associated with a lower BMI in Guyanese adults. Among black adults, farmers' markets were associated with a lower BMI, whereas supermarkets, wholesale clubs, and food pantries were associated with a higher BMI. Among white adults, food coops and supermarkets were associated with a lower BMI and wholesale clubs were associated with a higher BMI. Neighborhoods with less a favorable food environment (longer travel distance to a supermarket) were associated with a lower BMI in Guyanese adults.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nBoth primary (ie, supermarkets) and secondary food shopping venues could be independent determinants of BMI. The observed variations by race and ethnicity provided insights into a culturally tailored approach to address obesity.",

        "abstract": "More than 20% of children nationally live in poverty. Pediatric primary care practices are critical points-of-contact for these patients and their families. Practices must consider risks that are rooted in poverty as they determine how to best deliver family-centered care and move toward action on the social determinants of health. The Practice-Level Care Delivery Subgroup of the Academic Pediatric Association's Task Force on Poverty has developed a roadmap for pediatric providers and practices to use as they adopt clinical practice redesign strategies aimed at mitigating poverty's negative impact on child health and well-being. The present article describes how care structures and processes can be altered in ways that align with the needs of families living in poverty. Attention is paid to both facilitators of and barriers to successful redesign strategies. We also illustrate how such a roadmap can be adapted by practices depending on the degree of patient need and the availability of practice resources devoted to intervening on the social determinants of health. In addition, ways in which practices can advocate for families in their communities and nationally are identified. Finally, given the relative dearth of evidence for many poverty-focused interventions in primary care, areas that would benefit from more in-depth study are considered. Such a focus is especially relevant as practices consider how they can best help families mitigate the impact of poverty-related risks in ways that promote long-term health and well-being for children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMobile markets are an increasingly popular method for providing access to fresh fruits and vegetables (F/V) in underserved communities; however, evaluation of these programs is limited, as are descriptions of their development, study designs, and needs of the populations they serve.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur aim was to describe the development and theoretical basis for Veggie Van (VV), a mobile produce market intervention, the study design for the VV evaluation, and baseline characteristics of the study population.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe protocol and sample for a cluster-randomized controlled trial with 12 sites are described.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nCommunity partner organizations in the Triangle region of North Carolina that primarily served lower-income families or were located in areas that had limited access to fresh produce were recruited. Eligible individuals at each site (older than 18 years of age, self-identified as the main shoppers for their household, and expressed interest in using a mobile market) were targeted for enrollment. A total of 201 participants at 12 sites participated in the VV program and evaluation, which was implemented from November 2013 to March 2016.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nChange in F/V intake (cups/day), derived from self-reported responses to the National Cancer Institute F/V screener, was the main outcome measure.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED\nWe performed a descriptive analysis of baseline sample characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean reported F/V intake was 3.4 cups/day. Participants reported generally having some access to fresh F/V, and 57.7% agreed they could afford enough F/V to feed their family. The most frequently cited barriers were cost (55.7%) and time to prepare F/V (20.4%). Self-efficacy was lowest for buying more F/V than usual and trying new vegetables.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBy addressing cost and convenience and building skills for purchasing and preparing F/V, the VV has the potential to improve F/V consumption in underserved communities.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nThis study examined how mothers' Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) relate to their children's developmental risk and assessed how the association is mediated through mothers' depressive symptoms and fair/poor health.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMothers of children aged between 4 months and 4 years were recruited from the emergency department of a children's hospital between March 2012 and June 2015 and interviewed about ACEs, mothers' depressive symptoms and health status, and children's developmental risk (screened via Parents' Evaluations of Developmental Status [PEDS]). Between August and November 2016 a Cochran-Armitage test assessed trend of PEDS by ACEs. Multinomial regression models examined differences in PEDS by ACEs severity. Mediation by mothers' depressive symptoms and self-rated health was also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,293 mothers, 56.7% reported one or more ACEs. Mothers also reported developmental risk (20.4% overall): 120 (9.2%) reported one concern and 144 (11.2%) reported two or more concerns on the PEDS. Mothers who reported household substance use, mental illness, or an incarcerated household member during childhood were more likely to report at least one child developmental concern on the PEDS. After controlling for covariates, odds of one PEDS concern were 1.86 (95% CI=1.16, 3.00) for ACEs, one to three versus none, and 2.21 (95% CI=1.26, 3.87) for ACEs four or more versus none. Adjusted odds of two or more concerns were 1.70 (95% CI=1.07, 2.72) for ACEs, one to three versus none, and 1.76 (95% CI=1.02, 3.05) for ACEs, four or more versus none. Mothers' depressive symptoms and self-rated health were potential mediators.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMothers' ACEs are significantly associated with their children's developmental risk. If replicated, findings suggest that addressing intergenerational trauma through focus on childhood adversity among young children's caregivers may promote child development.",

        "abstract": "Using data from the 1996–2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the 2009–2016 American Community Survey, we examine trends in U.S. children living in shared households (living with adults beyond their nuclear (parent/parent’s partner/sibling) family). We find that although the share of children who lived in a shared household increased over this period, the rise was nearly entirely driven by an increase in three-generation/multigenerational households (coresident grandparent(s), parent(s), and child). In 1996, 5.7 % of children lived in a three-generation household; by 2016, 9.8 % did likewise—more than a 4 percentage point increase. More economically advantaged groups (older, more educated mothers, married households) experienced the largest percentage increase in three-generation coresidence, although correlates of coresidence remained largely stable. Decomposition analyses suggest that the rise in Social Security receipt and changes in parental relationship status (less marriage, more single parenthood) most strongly explained the increase in three-generation households. Given the dramatic rise in three-generation households, more research is needed to understand the consequences of these living arrangements for children, their parents, and their grandparents.",

        "abstract": "Although immigrants are healthier than non-immigrants on numerous outcomes, the reverse appears to be true with regards to food insecurity. Most studies ignore heterogeneity in the risk for food insecurity within immigration status and by ethnicity, even though significant variation likely exists. We consider how immigration status and ethnicity are related to trends in food insecurity among Latinos and Asians in California from 2001 through 2011. Data come from the 2001 to 2011 restricted California Health Interview Survey (n=245,679). We categorized Latinos and Asians as US-born, naturalized/legal permanent residents (naturalized/LPR), and non-LPRs (students, temporary workers, refugees, and undocumented persons). Multivariable weighted logistic regression analyses assessed temporal trends over the 10-year period after adjustment for demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and program participation. Across this period, US-born Asians reported similar levels of food insecurity as US-born Whites. Conversely, Latinos, regardless of immigration status or nativity, and Asian immigrants (i.e., naturalized/LPR and non-LPR) reported greater food insecurity than US-born Whites. Further, from 2001 through 2009, non-LPR Latinos reported higher risk of food insecurity than naturalized/LPR Latinos. Thus, food insecurity differs between ethnic groups, but also differs within ethnic group by immigration status. Efforts to reduce food insecurity should consider the additional barriers to access that are faced by immigrants, particularly those without legal permanent residency.",

The present study examines 241 pregnant incarcerated women's service requests and preincarceration service utilization related to material help (e.g., food, housing), mental health (e.g., counseling), family services (e.g., home-visiting nurses), and health care (e.g., insurance). A subsample (n = 74) also provided information about service utilization following their release from jail. Analyses examined request and utilization patterns in relation to other sociodemographic risk experiences. Results show that specific risk factors such as age, as well as the accumulation of multiple risk factors, served as barriers to requesting and accessing community-based services. The present study illuminates unique challenges pregnant incarcerated women experience requesting and utilizing services. The results support the use of a gender-responsive, trauma-informed approach to better address the needs of these women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).",

        "abstract": "Abstract:Families experiencing homelessness struggle with food access and face a high burden of nutrition-related diseases. We assessed feasibility of Feastworthy, a prepared meal delivery program for families in motel-shelters with meals made from surplus food from local colleges. We used pre-and post-program surveys and semi-structured interviews, comparing participating families with families in a nearby shelter. During the three-month pilot, Feastworthy delivered 4,875 meals to 38 families; 33 families participated in the study (20 intervention and 13 control). Families reported that the motel-shelter worsened their diet and health, and reported increased food security and healthier diets with Feastworthy. In difference-in-differences analyses, vegetable intake trended upward by 0.6 servings/day (p=.08) among participants relative to comparison-site individuals. Changes in food security scores and out-of-pocket food expenses were no different. A delivered meal program was feasible and may provide health benefits for homeless families. Future larger-scale, longer-term studies will clarify its befits.",

        "abstract": "The associations of family, home visitor and site characteristics with family engagement within the first 6 months were examined. The variation in family engagement was also explored. Home visiting program participants were drawn from 21 Healthy Families America sites (1707 families) and 9 Nurse-Family Partnership sites (650 families) in New Jersey. Three-level nested generalized linear mixed models assessed the associations of family, home visitor and site characteristics with family receipt of a high dose of services in the first 6 months of enrollment. A family was considered to have received a high dose of service in the first 6 months of enrollment if they were active at 6 months and had received at least 50% of their expected visits in the first 6 months. In general, both home visiting programs engaged, at a relatively high level (Healthy Families America (HFA) 59%, Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) 64%), with families demonstrating high-risk characteristics such as lower maternal education, maternal smoking, and maternal mental health need. Home visitor characteristics explained more of the variation (87%) in the receipt of services for HFA, while family characteristics explained more of the variation (75%) in the receipt of services for NFP. At the family level, NFP may improve the consistency with which they engage families by increasing retention efforts among mothers with lower education and smoking mothers. HFA sites seeking to improve engagement consistency should consider increasing the flexible in home visitor job responsibilities and examining the current expected-visit policies followed by home visitors on difficult-to-engage families.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most interventions designed to reduce teen pregnancy rates have not focused on pregnant and/or parenting adolescents. Therefore, a large randomized controlled trial was conducted regarding a motivational interviewing program entitled Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy in a low‐income sample of adolescent mothers. This program recommended monthly sessions between a participant and a registered nurse over 18 months. This program also featured facilitated birth control access through transportation assistance and a part‐time contraceptive clinic. OBJECTIVE: The impact of this program on rapid repeat pregnancies at 18 months after enrollment was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: Five hundred ninety‐eight adolescent females were enrolled from 7 obstetrics‐gynecology clinics and 5 postpartum units of a large hospital system in a Midwestern city. Each participant was enrolled at least 28 weeks pregnant or less than 9 weeks postpartum. Each participant was randomized to either the Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy intervention or a usual‐care control condition. Intervention participants averaged 4.5 hours of assistance. Participants were contacted by blinded research staff at 6 and 18 months to complete self‐report surveys. Differences in outcomes between the intervention and control groups were assessed using ordinary least‐squares regression. RESULTS: There was an 18.1% absolute reduction in self‐reported repeat pregnancy in the intervention group relative to the control group (20.5% vs 38.6%%; P < .001). There was a 13.7% absolute increase in self‐reported long‐acting reversible contraception use in the intervention group relative to the control group (40.2% vs 26.5%, P = .002). There was no evidence of harmful effects of the intervention on sexual risk behaviors, such as having sexual intercourse without a condom or greater number of partners. CONCLUSION: The Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy program represents one of the few evidence‐based interventions to reduce rapid repeat teen pregnancy. This relatively brief intervention may be a viable alternative to more time‐intensive programs that adolescent mothers may be unable or unwilling to receive.",

Food security, an area of disadvantage that can influence overall health, has not been fully explored for this population.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS\nTo examine levels of food security between young adults with and without disabilities, controlling for individual characteristics.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLogistic regression analysis of a nationally representative sample of young adults (age 18-25) (n = 32,795) with and without disabilities, using pooled data form the 2011-2013 National Health Interview Survey.\n\n\nRESULTS\nYoung adults with disabilities have significantly higher odds (OR: 2.58, p < 0.001) of living in a household that is food insecure than young adults without disabilities, even when controlling for individual characteristics. Odds of living in a household that is food insecure are particularly high (OR: 5.35, p < 0.001) among young adults with high levels of psychological distress, controlling for other factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nYoung adults with disabilities have increased odds of living in a household that is food insecure. This study has important policy and community program implications.",

By analyzing health variables compiled as part of the 2014 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings, we constructed four health indices and compared their spatial patterns to spatial patterns found in food insecurity data obtained from 2014 Feeding America's County Map the Meal Gap data. Clusters of low and high food security that overlapped with clusters of good or poor health were identified using Local Moran's I statistics. Next, multinomial logistic regressions were estimated to identify sociodemographic, urban/rural, and economic correlates of counties lying within overlapping clusters. In general, poor health and high food insecurity clusters, \"unfavorable cluster overlaps\", were present in the Mississippi Delta, Black Belt, Appalachia, and Alaska. Overlapping good health and low food insecurity clusters, \"favorable cluster overlaps\", were less common and located in the Corn Belt and New England. Counties with higher black populations and higher poverty were associated with an increased likelihood of lying within overlapping clusters of poor health and high food insecurity. Generally consistent patterns in spatial overlaps between food security and health indicate potential for shared causal mechanisms. Identified regions and county-level characteristics associated with being located inside of overlapping clusters may be used in future place-based intervention and policy.",

        "abstract": "Between 1968 and 2013, the poverty rate of young children age 0 to 5 years fell by nearly one third, in large part because of the role played by anti-poverty programs. However, young children in the U.S. still face a much higher rate of poverty than do older children in the U.S. They also continue to have a much higher poverty rate than do young children in other developed countries around the world. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of trends in poverty and the role of anti-poverty programs in addressing poverty among young children, using an improved measure of poverty, the Supplemental Poverty Measure. We examine changes over time and the current status, both for young children overall and for key subgroups (by child age, and by child race/ethnicity). Our findings can be summarized in three key points. First, poverty among all young children age 0-5 years has fallen since the beginning of our time series; but absent the safety net, today's poverty rate among young children would be identical to or higher than it was in 1968. Second, the safety net plays an increasing role in reducing the poverty of young children, especially among Black non-Hispanic children, whose poverty rate would otherwise be 20.8 percentage points higher in 2013. Third, the composition of support has changed from virtually all cash transfers in 1968, to about one third each of cash, credit and in-kind transfers today.",

        "abstract": "Nutrition assistance programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs (NSLP/SBP), and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), are intended to offer low-income families the opportunity for a healthier food pattern that promotes overall health and reduces risk for chronic disease. To be successful in improving the diets of underserved Americans requires a unified approach toward meeting the nutritional needs of program participants. Newly revised recommendations increase intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain-rich foods while reducing consumption of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. In addition to improving the nutritional profile of meals and snacks for NSLP and CACFP and meal patterns for WIC, the new recommendations ensure variety within food groups for menus across a week and allow for regional and cultural preferences and increased flexibility of choice within food groups. The newly revised meal pattern recommendations are broadly applicable to the design of feeding programs for any age group and for any combination of meals and snacks being provided.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nDepression is a serious mental health disorder, and untangling its causal agents is a major public health priority in the United States. This study examines the relationship between participating in welfare programs during childhood and experiencing depression during young adulthood.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis study used wave I and IV data from the Add Health (N = 15,701). Multiple imputation is used to deal with missing data. Propensity score matching is used to reduce the selection bias, and then multiple regressions were used to examine the welfare participation and depression relationships.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, young adults from welfare-recipient families reported significantly higher depression scores, rather than the clinical diagnosis of depression. Subgroup analyses showed only the poor group had significantly higher depression scores, whereas only the near-poor group had a significantly diagnosed depression outcome. Additionally, significantly higher depression scores were found for female youth from welfare-recipient families. However, no significant differences were found between the gender groups regarding diagnosed depression.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nUsing welfare participation as an economic marker, the subgroup analyses help to identify target populations for future intervention. Implications of this study will be of interest to policy makers and have value for informing policy decisions.",

        "abstract": "Because children from low-income families benefit from preschool but are less likely than other children to enroll, identifying factors that promote their enrollment can support research and policy aiming to reduce socioeconomic disparities in education. In this study, we tested an accommodations model with data on 6,250 children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. In general, parental necessity (e.g., maternal employment) and human capital considerations (e.g., maternal education) most consistently predicted preschool enrollment among children from low-income families. Supply side factors (e.g., local child care options) and more necessity and human capital factors (e.g., having fewer children, desiring preparation for school) selected such children into preschool over parental care or other care arrangements, and several necessity factors (e.g., being less concerned about costs) selected them into non-Head Start preschools over Head Start programs. Systemic connections and child elicitation did not consistently predict preschool enrollment in this population.",

        "abstract": "We conducted a pilot evaluation of the Veggie Van, a mobile produce market that brings weekly boxes of reduced-cost locally grown fruits and vegetables (F&V) to lower-income communities and offers cooking and nutrition education to customers. We conducted surveys just prior to starting Veggie Van at each of 3 sites and again at 2-3 months. F&V intake was measured with a 2-question item and a 10-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in a subset of participants. At baseline, average servings/day of F&V was 4.9 (SD = 2.6, n = 60). At follow-up, individuals who reported shopping at Veggie Van frequently (n = 32) increased their F&V consumption by 0.41 servings/day compared with a decrease of -1.19 for those who rarely/never used Veggie Van (n = 27), a total difference of 1.6 servings/day (P = .01). There were no statistically significant differences in F&V consumption between groups based on the FFQ measure. Frequent shoppers reported additional health improvements and increases in their ability to buy enough F&V. We conclude that offering weekly boxes of affordable F&V paired with education in underserved communities may improve F&V consumption for frequent program users.",

        "abstract": "This study examines historical trends in poverty using an anchored version of the U.S. Census Bureau’s recently developed Research Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) estimated back to 1967. Although the SPM is estimated each year using a quasi-relative poverty threshold that varies over time with changes in families’ expenditures on a core basket of goods and services, this study explores trends in poverty using an absolute, or anchored, SPM threshold. We believe the anchored measure offers two advantages. First, setting the threshold at the SPM’s 2012 levels and estimating it back to 1967, adjusted only for changes in prices, is more directly comparable to the approach taken in official poverty statistics. Second, it allows for a better accounting of the roles that social policy, the labor market, and changing demographics play in trends in poverty rates over time, given that changes in the threshold are held constant. Results indicate that unlike official statistics that have shown poverty rates to be fairly flat since the 1960s, poverty rates have dropped by 40 % when measured using a historical anchored SPM over the same period. Results obtained from comparing poverty rates using a pretax/pretransfer measure of resources versus a post-tax/post-transfer measure of resources further show that government policies, not market incomes, are driving the declines observed over time.",

        "abstract": "Objectives This paper aims to describe low-income recipients of a community-based diaper bank and the multiple daily challenges they face. Our paper seeks to document the health, social, and financial outcomes recipients experienced after receiving assistance. Methods We surveyed families (n = 150) about their experiences receiving diapers from a diaper bank in the southeastern United States. Additionally, we conducted short, focused interviews with families (n = 15) about outcomes after receiving diapers. Results Families experience regularly a range of challenges meeting basic needs. These difficulties include high unmet needs for transportation, food, and nonfood essentials such as personal hygiene items. Families experiencing the greatest difficulty in paying utility or medical bills were significantly more likely to have a high level of diaper need compared to families facing these challenges less often (AORs ranging from 3.40 to 9.39). As a result of receiving diapers, families reported positive health, social, and economic outcomes. Families reported positive changes in parental mood; improved child health and happiness; increased opportunities for childcare, work, and school attendance; and the ability to divert household finances toward other basic needs, including utilities and medical care. Conclusions for Practice The monetary value of the supplemental provision of diapers is a small investment in affected families’ economic, social, and health outcomes. The positive effects continue far longer than the diapers provided. We demonstrate the social value of such an operation, and recommend the expansion of federal, state, and local safety net programs to help low-income families secure a steady supply of diapers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn 2012, 20% of households in the United States with children lacked consistent access to adequate food. Food insufficiency has significant implications for children, including poor physical and mental health outcomes, behavior problems, and low educational achievements. The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is one policy solution to reduce food insufficiency among children from low-income families.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this project was to evaluate the association between NSLP participation and household food insufficiency by examining trajectories of food insufficiency over 10 calendar months. The calendar months included both nonsummer months when school is in session and summer months when school is out of session.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study used the data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and conducted linear growth curve analyses in the multilevel modeling context. Comparisons were made between the trajectories of food insufficiencies among recipients of free or reduced-price lunch and their counterparts who are eligible but choose not to participate in the program.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHeads of households that included children receiving free or reduced-price lunch (n = 6867) were more likely to be female, black, unmarried, and unemployed, and have a lower educational attainment than those whose children were eligible but did not receive free or reduced-price lunch (n = 11,396). For households participating in the NSLP, the food insufficiency rate was consistent from January to May at ∼4%, and then increased in June and July to >5%. Meanwhile, food insufficiency among eligible nonrecipients was constant throughout the year at nearly 2%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe NSLP protects households from food insufficiency. Policies should be instituted to make enrollment easier for households.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nExposure to childhood adversity, including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction, is associated with negative long-term health and economic outcomes. Little is known about how adversity exposure in parents' early lives may be related to later food insecurity for parents and their children. This study investigated the association between female caregivers' adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and household and child food insecurity, taking into account depressive symptoms.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study used cross-sectional data from 1,255 female caregivers of children aged <4 years surveyed in an urban clinical setting from March 2012 through June 2014. Measures included sociodemographic characteristics; caregivers' ACEs, including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction; depressive symptoms; and household and child food insecurity. Multinomial and logistic regression analyses assessed the relationship among ACEs, depressive symptoms, and household and child food security status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCaregiver depressive symptoms modified associations between ACEs and food insecurity level. After adjusting for covariates, caregivers reporting both depressive symptoms and four or more ACEs were 12.3 times as likely to report low food security (95% CI=6.2, 24.7); 28.8 times as likely to report very low food security (95% CI=12.8, 64.8); and 17.6 times as likely to report child food insecurity (95% CI=7.3, 42.6) compared with those reporting no depressive symptoms and no ACEs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDepressive symptoms and ACEs were independently associated with household and child food insecurity, and depressive symptoms modified the association between ACEs and household and child food insecurity. Comprehensive policy interventions incorporating nutrition assistance and behavioral health may address intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.",

        "abstract": "Child poverty in the United States is widespread and has serious negative effects on the health and well-being of children throughout their life course. Child health providers are considering ways to redesign their practices in order to mitigate the negative effects of poverty on children and support the efforts of families to lift themselves out of poverty. To do so, practices need to adopt effective methods to identify poverty-related social determinants of health and provide effective interventions to address them. Identification of needs can be accomplished with a variety of established screening tools. Interventions may include resource directories, best maintained in collaboration with local/regional public health, community, and/or professional organizations; programs embedded in the practice (eg, Reach Out and Read, Healthy Steps for Young Children, Medical-Legal Partnership, Health Leads); and collaboration with home visiting programs. Changes to health care financing are needed to support the delivery of these enhanced services, and active advocacy by child health providers continues to be important in effecting change. We highlight the ongoing work of the Health Care Delivery Subcommittee of the Academic Pediatric Association Task Force on Child Poverty in defining the ways in which child health care practice can be adapted to improve the approach to addressing child poverty.",

        "abstract": "This review addresses epidemiological, public health, and social policy implications of categorizing young children and their adult female caregivers in the United States as food secure when they live in households with \"marginal food security,\" as indicated by the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module. Existing literature shows that households in the US with marginal food security are more like food-insecure households than food-secure households. Similarities include socio-demographic characteristics, psychosocial profiles, and patterns of disease and health risk. Building on existing knowledge, we present new research on associations of marginal food security with health and developmental risks in young children (<48 mo) and health in their female caregivers. Marginal food security is positively associated with adverse health outcomes compared with food security, but the strength of the associations is weaker than that for food insecurity as usually defined in the US. Nonoverlapping CIs, when comparing odds of marginally food-secure children's fair/poor health and developmental risk and caregivers' depressive symptoms and fair/poor health with those in food-secure and -insecure families, indicate associations of marginal food security significantly and distinctly intermediate between those of food security and food insecurity. Evidence from reviewed research and the new research presented indicates that households with marginal food security should not be classified as food secure, as is the current practice, but should be reported in a separate discrete category. These findings highlight the potential underestimation of the prevalence of adverse health outcomes associated with exposure to lack of enough food for an active, healthy life in the US and indicate an even greater need for preventive action and policies to limit and reduce exposure among children and mothers.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, scholars have pointed to the politically demobilizing effects of means-tested assistance programs on recipients. In this study, we bridge the insights from policy feedback literature and adolescent political socialization research to examine how receiving means-tested programs shapes parent influence on adolescent political participation. We argue that there are differences in pathways to political participation through parent political socialization and youth internal efficacy beliefs for adolescents from households that do or do not receive means-tested assistance. Using data from a nationally representative sample of 536 Black, Latino, and White adolescents (50.8% female), we find that adolescents from means-tested assistance households report less parent political socialization and political participation. For all youth, parent political socialization predicts adolescent political participation. Internal political efficacy is a stronger predictor of political participation for youth from a non-means-tested assistance household than it is for youth from a household receiving means-tested assistance. These findings provide some evidence of differential paths to youth political participation via exposure to means-tested programs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) requires states to measure and report on coverage stability in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). States generally have not done this in the past. This study proposes strategies for both measuring stability and targeting policies to improve retention of Medicaid coverage, using Ohio as an example.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cohort of newly enrolled children was constructed for the 1-year time period between July 2007 and June 2008 and followed for 18 months. Hazard ratios were estimated after 18 months to predict the likelihood of maintaining continuous enrollment in Medicaid, adjusting for income eligibility group, age, race, gender, county type, and change in unemployment. Children dropping from the program at the renewal period (12-16 months) were followed for 12 months to determine their rate of return.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately 26% of children aged <1 year and 35% of children aged 1 to 16 years dropped from Medicaid by 18 months, with the steepest drop occurring after 12 months, the point of renewal. Likelihood of dropping was associated with the higher income eligibility groups, older children, and Hispanic ethnicity. Approximately 40% of children who were dropped at renewal re-enrolled within 12 months. Children in the lowest income group returned sooner and in higher proportions than other children.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA substantial number of children lose Medicaid coverage only to re-enroll within a short time. Income eligibility group appears to be a strong indicator of stability. Effective monitoring of coverage stability is important for developing policies to increase retention of eligible children.",

        "abstract": "Almost half of young children in the United States live in poverty or near poverty. The American Academy of Pediatrics is committed to reducing and ultimately eliminating child poverty in the United States. Poverty and related social determinants of health can lead to adverse health outcomes in childhood and across the life course, negatively affecting physical health, socioemotional development, and educational achievement. The American Academy of Pediatrics advocates for programs and policies that have been shown to improve the quality of life and health outcomes for children and families living in poverty. With an awareness and understanding of the effects of poverty on children, pediatricians and other pediatric health practitioners in a family-centered medical home can assess the financial stability of families, link families to resources, and coordinate care with community partners. Further research, advocacy, and continuing education will improve the ability of pediatricians to address the social determinants of health when caring for children who live in poverty. Accompanying this policy statement is a technical report that describes current knowledge on child poverty and the mechanisms by which poverty influences the health and well-being of children.",

        "abstract": "We study the factors associated with food insecurity and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Mexican immigrant families in the US. Estimates from analyses that control for a rich set of economic, demographic, and geographic variables show that children in Mexican immigrant families are more likely to be food insecure than children in native families, but are less likely to participate in SNAP. Further, more vulnerable groups such as the first-generation Mexican immigrant families, families in the US for less than 5 years, and families with non-citizen children - that are at a higher risk of food insecurity are the least likely to participate in SNAP. Our analysis suggests that the US Department of Agriculture outreach initiative and SNAP expansion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act increased SNAP participation of the mixed-status Mexican families. We do not find any evidence that the outreach and ARRA expansion increased SNAP receipt among Mexican immigrant families with only non-citizen members who are likely to be undocumented.",

        "abstract": "The disproportionate number of individuals who are obese or overweight in the low-income U.S. population has raised interest in the influence of neighborhood conditions and public assistance programs on weight and health. Generally, neighborhood effects and program participation effects have been explored in separate studies. We unite these two areas of inquiry, using the 1968–2005 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine the long-term effects of childhood Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation, neighborhood conditions, and the interaction of these two, on adult body mass index (BMI). Using sibling fixed-effects models to account for selection bias, we find that relative to children in other low-income families, children in SNAP-recipient households have higher average adult BMI values. However, the effects of childhood SNAP usage are sensitive to both residential neighborhood and age at receipt. For those growing up in advantaged neighborhoods, projected adult BMI is higher for children in SNAP-recipient households than for children in low-income, nonrecipient households. In contrast, for those growing up in less-advantaged areas, adult BMI differences between children in SNAP-recipient and those in low-income, nonrecipient households are small. SNAP usage during preschool years (0 to 4) has no impact on adult BMI scores. However, at later childhood ages, the time elapsed receiving SNAP income increases adult BMI values relative to a condition of low-income nonreceipt.",

        "abstract": "The passage of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which we label welfare reform, decisively “ended welfare as we knew it” by eliminating the federal entitlement to cash assistance that Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) had provided for 60 years. The new cash assistance program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), is a fixed federal block grant that allows states to spend federal and state funds flexibly on cash assistance or a range of other services provided to needy families with children. PRWORA requires only that states enforce participation in work or work-related activities and impose time limits on the receipt of cash assistance from federal funds. Because it is not an entitlement program, TANF does not require states to provide benefits to all eligible families, nor does it require them to assume responsibility for guaranteeing unemployed recipients who reach their time limit a job if they cannot find one. As a result, the transition to the new “work-based safety net” remains incomplete: neither thefederal government nor the statesreplaced theentitlement to cash assistance with an entitlement to participate in work or work-related activities. TANF includes incentives that encourage states to minimize their cash assistance caseloads, even when recessions increase the number of eligible families. First, the amount of block grant funds has not changed since the program was enacted. A state’s allocation is not responsive to population growth or increased economic hardship. Second, funds not used for cash assistance can be reallocated to other related purposes. Third, states can satisfy the work participation benchmarks either by getting more recipients into work-related activities or jobs (which can be expensive) or simply by keeping caseloads small. In contrast to this reduction in public responsibility, TANF requires more responsibility from recipients. Indeed, it achieved its goal of eliminating long-term dependence on cash assistance. A recipient can no longer reject a job offer and continue to receive cash assistance. If she does not cooperate with the welfare agency, she can be sanctioned and her family can be removed from the welfare rolls. She can also be removed when she reaches her time limit, even if she is actively seeking work and willing to work for her cash assistance.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity rates have risen significantly in the United States beginning with the recent recession and remained high. The implications of these high rates are severe in that food insecurity has been associated with a wide range of health, behavioral, social and cognitive difficulties. This paper examines the relationship between the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and food insecurity outcomes. The SBP has the potential to reduce food insecurity because of the direct provision of breakfast to students and the implied income transfer to households. We use state-level cutoffs tied to school-level poverty rates that mandate the provision of the SBP to compare the food security outcomes of students in similar schools, but with different requirements to provide breakfast. Our estimates suggest that state policies requiring schools to offer the SBP have reduced food insecurity for young children.",

        "abstract": "Direct income supports have long been known to substantially reduce the extent and depth of poverty. Evidence suggests that they can also bolster children's opportunities to succeed and enhance long-term mobility. A growing body of research, for example, links income from 2 related tax credits for working families-the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit-to benefits for children in those families, such as improved birth weight, better school outcomes, and increased rates of employment in adulthood. Similarly, the introduction of food stamps has been found to improve not only the birth weight of infants given access to the program but also their educational achievement, as well as indicators of health, well-being, and self-sufficiency decades later. These are striking research results for income support that is not typically thought of as improving children's health or education. The mechanisms through which these income supports lead to such benefits are likely varied and complex, but emerging research suggests that helping families with children afford basic necessities can reduce the added stress of financial difficulties, preventing downstream neuroendocrine and biochemical changes that affect children's longer-term outcomes. These findings have important implications for policy makers. Research suggests that potential weakening of the safety net would not only substantially increase poverty, but also have damaging long-term effects on children. Policy makers should reject funding cuts and instead strengthen the safety net, which this analysis suggests could reduce poverty further and also enhance children's opportunities to succeed.",

        "abstract": "Although social and economic policies are not considered part of health services infrastructure, such policies may influence health and disease by altering social determinants of health (SDH). We review social and economic policies in the USA that have measured health outcomes among adults in four domains of SDH including housing and neighborhood, employment, family strengthening/marriage, and income supplementation. The majority of these policies target low-income populations. These social policies rarely consider health as their initial mission or outcomes. When measuring health, the programs document mental health and physical health benefits more than half the time, although some effects fade with time. We also find considerable segregation of program eligibility by gender and family composition. Policy makers should design future social policies to evaluate health outcomes using validated health measures; to target women more broadly across the socioeconomic spectrum; and to consider family caregiving responsibilities, as ignoring them can have unintended health effects.",

Nine focus groups were conducted separately with grandparent caregivers (n = 46) and youth (n = 34), and interviews were conducted with key informants (n = 17) knowledgeable about housing and issues. Housing needs of greatest priority, contextual differences, and potential barriers to securing housing and social services were identified. Key themes indicated that housing challenges stem from four problem domains: the experience of poverty, which creates affordability challenges that trap grandparent caregivers and their grandchildren in unsuitable homes and unsafe neighborhoods; physical challenges of aging grandparents, which require specific housing accommodations; changes in family composition when taking in grandchildren, which necessitate moving out of prior accommodations or changing housing plans due to regulatory issues; and obstacles to obtaining needed benefits, including a lack of information, burdensome application processes, ineligibility, and a shortage of resources. These issues are discussed with implications for policy and practice.",

        "abstract": "In environments in which female economic dependence on a male mate is higher, male parental investment is more essential. In such environments, therefore, both sexes should value paternity certainty more and thus object more to promiscuity (because promiscuity undermines paternity certainty). We tested this theory of anti-promiscuity morality in two studies (N = 656 and N = 4,626) using U.S. samples. In both, we examined whether opposition to promiscuity was higher among people who perceived greater female economic dependence in their social network. In Study 2, we also tested whether economic indicators of female economic dependence (e.g., female income, welfare availability) predicted anti-promiscuity morality at the state level. Results from both studies supported the proposed theory. At the individual level, perceived female economic dependence explained significant variance in anti-promiscuity morality, even after controlling for variance explained by age, sex, religiosity, political conservatism, and the anti-promiscuity views of geographical neighbors. At the state level, median female income was strongly negatively related to anti-promiscuity morality and this relationship was fully mediated by perceived female economic dependence. These results were consistent with the view that anti-promiscuity beliefs may function to promote paternity certainty in circumstances where male parental investment is particularly important.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nScreening for social determinants of health is challenging but critically important for optimizing child health outcomes. We aimed to test the feasibility of using an integrated state agency administrative database to identify social complexity risk factors and examined their relationship to emergency department (ED) use.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study among children younger than 18 years with Washington State Medicaid insurance coverage (N = 505,367). We linked child and parent administrative data for this cohort to identify a set of social complexity risk factors, such as poverty and parent mental illness, that have either a known or hypothesized association with suboptimal health care use. Using multivariate analyses, we examined associations of each risk factor and of number of risk factors with the rate of ED use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNine of 11 identifiable social complexity risk factors were associated with a higher rate of ED use. Additionally, the rate increased as the number of risk factors increased from 0 to 5 or more, reaching approximately twice the rate when 5 or more risk factors were present in children aged younger than 5 years (incidence rate ratio = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.85-2.00) and in children aged 5 to 17 years (incidence rate ratio = 2.06; 95% CI, 1.99-2.14).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nState administrative data can be used to identify social complexity risk factors associated with higher rates of ED use among Medicaid-insured children. State agencies could give primary care medical homes a social risk flag or score to facilitate targeted screening and identification of needed resources, potentially preventing future unnecessary ED use in this vulnerable population of children.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nIn 2014, 30% of African-American households with children had low or very low food security, a rate double that of white households with children. A household has low food security if its members experience food shortages and reductions in food quality attributable to a lack of household resources or access and very low food security if its members also experience reductions in food intake and disrupted eating patterns. Households that are either low or very low food secure are known collectively as food insecure. We examined the association between the severity of household food insecurity and reports of lifetime racial discrimination among a sample of food-insecure African-American households in South Carolina.\n\n\nDESIGN\nData were collected from 154 African-American respondents. Food insecurity was measured using the US Department of Agriculture's Household Food Security Survey Module. Lifetime racial discrimination was measured using the Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire-Community Version (PEDQ-CV). We used logistic regression to test the association between severity of food insecurity (low vs. very low food secure), PEDQ-CV score and PEDQ-CV subscales. All models were adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA one-unit increase in the frequency of lifetime racial discrimination was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of being very low food secure (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, P < .05). More reports of discrimination that were stigmatizing or devaluing (OR 1.16, P < .05), took place at a workplace or school (OR 1.15, P < .05) or were threatening or aggressive (OR 1.39, P < .05) increased the odds of being very low food secure. More reports of racial discrimination that were excluding or rejecting did not significantly increase the odds of being very low food secure (OR 1.07, P > .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSeverity of household food insecurity is associated with lifetime racial discrimination among African-American households in South Carolina.",

        "abstract": "Low fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption is associated with higher rates of obesity and chronic disease among low-income individuals. Understanding attitudes towards F&V consumption and addressing policy and environmental changes could help improve diet and reduce disease risk. A survey of North Carolinians receiving government assistance was used to describe benefits, barriers, and facilitators of eating F&V and shopping at farmers' markets in this population. A total of 341 eligible individuals from 14 counties completed the survey. The most commonly cited barriers to eating F&V were cost (26.4%) and not having time to prepare F&V (7.3%). Facilitators included access to affordable locally grown F&V (13.5%) and knowledge to quickly and easily prepare F&V (13.2%). Among people who did not use farmers' markets, common barriers to shopping there were not being able to use food assistance program benefits (35.3%) and not knowing of a farmers' market in their area (28.8%); common facilitators included transportation (24.8%) and having more information about farmers' market hours (22.9%). In addition to breaking down structural/environmental barriers to farmers' market usage, there is a need to disseminate promotional information about farmers' markets, including hours, location, and accepted forms of payment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract California’s rural agricultural communities face an increased burden of obesity and metabolic disease. The present objective is to define the social and environmental influences to child obesity and physical activity within Mexican-origin communities in California’s Central Valley. A range of data (anthropometric, socioeconomic, demographic, cultural and environmental) were collected on more than 650 children enrolled in Niños Sanos, Familia Sana. Physical activity data were gathered from a subsample of children 4–7 years of age (n = 148) via accelerometer. Cross sectional analyses explored the relationship between BMI and physical activity and the influence of numerous social and environmental variables. In this sample 45 % of children were determined to be overweight or obese. Boys had a higher daily average moderate-to-vigorous physical activity than girls (p = 0.008). Chi square analyses showed weight status was associated with activity level in girls (p = 0.03) but not boys. Multivariate regression revealed several social and environmental indicators influenced BMI and physical activity (p = 0.004). In this population of school-age children of Mexican-origin, girls may benefit more from targeted efforts to increase MVPA.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough several systematic reviews have concluded that home visiting has strong evidence of effectiveness, individual evaluations have produced inconsistent results. We used a component-based, domain-specific approach to determine which characteristics most strongly predict outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMedline and PsycINFO searches were used to identify evaluations of universal and selective home visiting programs implemented in the United States. Coders trained to the study criterion coded characteristics of research design, program content, and service delivery. We conducted random-effects, inverse-variance-weighted linear regressions by using program characteristics to predict effect sizes on 6 outcome domains (birth outcomes, parenting behavior and skills, maternal life course, child cognitive outcomes, child physical health, and child maltreatment).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAggregated to a single effect size per study (k = 51), the mean effect size was 0.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.14 to 0.27), with a range of -0.68 to 3.95. Mean effect sizes were significant and positive for 3 of the 6 outcome domains (maternal life course outcomes, child cognitive outcomes, and parent behaviors and skills), with heterogeneity of effect sizes in all 6 outcome domains. Research design characteristics generally did not predict effect sizes. No consistent pattern of effective components emerged across all outcome domains.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHome visiting programs demonstrated small but significant overall effects, with wide variability in the size of domain-specific effects and in the components that significantly predicted domain-specific effects. Communities may need complementary or alternative strategies to home visiting programs to ensure widespread impact on these 6 important public health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) reached an all-time high of 40.2 million persons in March 2010, which means the program affects a substantial fraction of Americans. A significant body of research has emerged suggesting that participation in SNAP increases the probability of being obese for adult women and has little effect on the probability for adult men. However, studies addressing the effects of participation on children have produced mixed results. This paper examines the effect of long-term SNAP participation on the Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile and probability of being overweight or obese for children ages 5-18 using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adults data set. An instrumental variables identification strategy that exploits exogenous variation in state-level program parameters, as well as state and federal expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), is used to address the endogeneity between SNAP participation and obesity. SNAP participation is found to significantly reduce BMI percentile and the probability of being overweight or obese for boys and girls ages 5-11 and boys ages 12-18. For girls ages 12-18, SNAP participation appears to have no significant effect on these outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The role of parent involvement in school readiness interventions is not well-understood. The Getting Ready for School (GRS) intervention is a novel program that has both home and school components and aims to improve early literacy, math, and self-regulatory skills in preschool children from socioeconomically disadvantaged families. In this study, we first examined associations between family characteristics and different indices of parent involvement in the GRS intervention. We then examined associations between parent involvement and change in children's school readiness skills over time. Participants were 133 preschool children attending Head Start and their parents who participated in the GRS intervention during the academic year 2014-2015. Parent involvement was operationalized as attendance to GRS events at the school, time spent at home doing GRS activities, and usage of digital program materials, which included a set of videos to support the implementation of parent-child activities at home. Although few family characteristics were significantly associated with parent involvement indices, there was a tendency for some markers of higher socioeconomic status to be linked with greater parent involvement. In addition, greater parent involvement in the GRS intervention was significantly associated with greater gains in children's early literacy, math, and self-regulatory skills. These findings suggest that parent involvement in comprehensive early interventions could be beneficial in terms of improving school readiness for preschoolers from disadvantaged families.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity has detrimental effects on the mental, physical, and behavioral health of developing children. Few studies, however, have sought to determine whether associations exist between food insecurity and intake of vegetables, fresh or canned fruit, candy or cookies, French fries, fast food, water, milk, fruit juices, fruit drinks, soda, and sports drinks. To identify independent associations that exist between maternal food insecurity and food and drink intake among toddlers, population-based data from the 2006–2008 Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System follow-back survey (Oregon PRAMS-2) of 1,522 mothers of 2-year-old children were analyzed. Maternal food insecurity was defined as mothers’ report of eating less because of lack of money for food. Typical weekly child food and drink intake was examined using polytomous logistic regression: 0–1 days/week, 2–3 days/week, and 4–7 days/week. Maternal food insecurity prevalence was 11.7 %. Compared to toddlers of food secure mothers, toddlers of food insecure mothers consumed vegetables (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for 4–7 days/week = 0.31; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.12, 0.79) and fruit (AOR for 4–7 days/week = 0.25; 95 % CI 0.08, 0.75) fewer days of the week. Toddlers of food insecure mothers consumed soda (AOR for 4–7 days/week = 3.21; 95 % CI 1.12, 9.14) more days of the week. Maternal food insecurity is associated with weekly intake of certain foods and drinks. Among toddlers, consumption of fewer vegetables and fruit, and more soda may help explain the link between food insecurity and poor health.",

        "abstract": "Programs of drug testing welfare recipients are increasingly common in US states and have been considered elsewhere. Though often intensely debated, such programs are complicated to evaluate because their aims are ambiguous-aims like saving money may be in tension with aims like referring people to treatment. We assess such programs using a proportionality approach, which requires that for ethical acceptability a practice must be reasonably likely to meet its aims, sufficiently important in purpose as to outweigh harms incurred, and lower in costs than feasible alternatives. In the light of empirical findings, we argue that the programs fail the three requirements. Pursuing recreational drug users is not important in the light of costs incurred, while dependent users who may require referral are usually identifiable without testing and typically need a broader approach than one focussing on drugs. Drug testing of welfare recipients is therefore not ethically acceptable policy.",

        "abstract": "Families have clearly benefited from increased availability of evidence-based intervention, including home-visiting models and increased federal funding for programs benefiting parents and children. The goal of population-level impact on the health and well-being of infants and young children across entire communities, however, remains elusive. New approaches are needed to move beyond scaling of individual programs toward an integrated system of care in early childhood. To advance this goal, the current article provides a framework for developing an early childhood system of care that pairs a top-down goal for the alignment of services with a bottom-up goal of identifying and addressing needs of all families throughout early childhood. Further, we describe how universal newborn home visiting can be utilized to both support alignment of and family entry into an early childhood system of care with broad reach, high quality, and evidence of population impact for families and children.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the mediating effect of loneliness on the relationship between pain interference and depressive symptoms and to determine whether this mechanism is contingent on employment status. Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: A total of 876 adult caregivers of adolescents living in extremely impoverished conditions. Analysis: Mediation and moderated mediation analyses using standard path-analytic approaches. Results: The mean age of the sample was 39.0 (SD = 12.8) years and 80.7% (n = 707) identified as female. Almost half (48.9%, n = 425) of the participants did not report any pain, while 32.5% (n = 285) reported non-disabling pain, and 19.0% (n = 166) reported disabling pain. The mean depressive symptoms score was 16.20 (SD = 10.6), and the mean loneliness score was 40.09 (SD = 10.5). Loneliness mediated the effect of both non-disabling and disabling pain on depressive symptoms. However, the indirect effect of pain interference on depressive symptoms through loneliness was more pronounced among participants reporting disabling pain (coefficient, 2.11; Boot 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.25–3.01)) than non-disabling pain (coefficient, 0.99; Boot 95% CI (0.25–1.76)). Moderated mediation results showed that the indirect effect of pain interference on depressive symptoms, via loneliness varied in magnitude as a function of employment status among participants reporting disabling pain but not those reporting non-disabling pain. Conclusion: Loneliness provides an important link in the relationship between depressive symptoms and pain interference. Furthermore, employment status is an important factor to consider, especially among individuals reporting disabling pain with comorbid depressive symptoms.",

For their adolescents, parenting practices for FV consumption was positively related to adolescents' FV consumption, but parents/caregivers' rules/limits to avoid junk food/SSBs were positively related to adolescents' junk foods and SSBs consumption.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nContinued parental modeling of dietary practices is important during adolescence. Future analyses should investigate adolescents' perceptions of parents' practices and behaviors as well as their exposure from other sources and their effect on adolescent (dietary) decision-making.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nAlthough patients who experience health-related social problems such as food insecurity are at increased risk for negative health outcomes, there are few systems for screening and intervention. The study aimed to determine whether a web-based intervention can (1) connect youth to services to address these problems and (2) increase their resolution.\n\n\nDESIGN\nProspective intervention study.\n\n\nSETTING/PARTICIPANTS\nA total of 401 youth, aged 15-25 years, from an urban adolescent/young adult clinic were recruited.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nA self-administered, web-based tool was developed to screen participants for problems in nine health-related social domains, identify and provide feedback about potential problems, and facilitate a patient-centered selection process of recommended local health and human service agencies to assist in addressing selected problems (conducted in 2008-2010). Follow-up phone calls 1-2 months later determined if patients had contacted recommended agencies and resolved their top-priority problem.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nOutcome measures included prevalence of identified problems, selected problems, and priority problem selected by domain. We also examined frequencies of referral agencies contacted and resolution of priority problem at time of follow-up analysis conducted in 2011-2013.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-eight percent (313/401) of youth selected at least one problem to address. The most frequent domains selected as priority were income security (21%); nutrition/fitness (15%); and healthcare access (15%). Eighty-three percent (259/313) were reached at follow-up; overall, 40% contacted a selected agency and 47% reported \"completely\" or \"mostly\" resolving their priority problem.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhen provided with services to address health-related social problems, the majority of youth choose to receive help, with nearly half successfully addressing their priority concern. Further research to understand the barriers to contacting and utilizing services is needed. A technology-based patient-centered feedback and referral system for social determinants of health can facilitate screening and connect patients with resources to address these problems.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although depression and financial distress are correlated, this association may differ for demographic groups, particularly based on race. Aim: Using a national sample of American adults, this study tested whether the association between Major Depressive Episode (MDE) and financial distress differs between African Americans and Whites. Methods: The National Survey of American Life (NSAL), 2003, enrolled 3570 African American and 891 Non-Hispanic White American adults. Demographic data (age and gender), socioeconomic position (SEP; i.e., education, employment, marital status, and income), financial distress, and 12-month MDE were measured. Logistic regression was used for data analysis. Results: In the pooled sample, 12-month MDE was associated with higher odds of financial distress, above and beyond objective SEP measures. We found MDE by race interaction on financial distress, suggesting stronger association between MDE and financial distress among African Americans, compared to Whites. Conclusions: The link between MDE and financial distress depends on race. The financial needs of African Americans with depression should be addressed. Depression screening is also needed for African Americans with financial distress.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMaternal mental illness constitutes one of most significant public health problems facing women of reproductive age and their children. Women who mother in poverty experience additional stressors, pointing to the need for innovative public health promotion efforts to reduce mental illness. Simple innovations, like making diapers more available and affordable, may represent an effective method of addressing this problem. This paper describes the research findings on diaper need reported by the New Haven Mental Health Outreach for Mothers Partnership and the process of translating these findings into broader policy and advocacy efforts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNational-, state-, and local-level diaper policy activities that occurred from 2013 to 2016 were examined after a journal article that focused on diaper need and associated psychosocial variables was published in Pediatrics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBased on analysis of policy activities that occurred from 2013 to 2016 after Pediatrics published the diaper need findings, several diaper-related policy activities were identified: 1 at the city level, 11 at the state level, and 2 at the federal level. Five of the identified activities represented policy changes that were enacted or implemented.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCommunity coalitions can effect gender-responsive policy change by conducting and disseminating research, engaging stakeholders, and mobilizing and leveraging their networks.",

        "abstract": "Importance Evidence indicates that there are potential health, development, and maternal bonding consequences for children born from unwanted pregnancies. Objective To examine the association of women receiving or being denied a wanted abortion with their children’s health and well-being. Design, Setting, and Participants A 5-year longitudinal observational study with a quasi-experimental design conducted between January 18, 2008, and January 25, 2016, examined women who received abortions just under the gestational age limit of 30 abortion facilities across the United States and women who were denied abortion just beyond the gestational age limit in these facilities. Analyses compared the children of 146 women who were denied an abortion (index children) with children born to 182 women who received an abortion and had a subsequent child within 5 years (subsequent children). Interview-to-interview retention averaged 94.5% (6895 of 7293) across the 11 semi-annual interviews. Exposures Being born after denial of abortion vs after a new pregnancy subsequent to an abortion. Main Outcomes and Measures Perinatal outcomes and child health, child development, maternal bonding, socioeconomics, and household structure. Results This study included 328 women who had children during the study period (mean [SD] age at study recruitment, 23.7 [4.9] years). There were no differences by study group in consent to participate in the study, completion of first interview, or continuation in the study. Among the 328 children in the study (146 index children and 182 subsequent children), there were 163 girls and 165 boys. Perinatal and child health outcomes were not different between subsequent and index children, and there was no clear pattern of delayed child development. However, mixed-effects models adjusting for clustered recruitment and multiple observations per child revealed that poor maternal bonding was more common for index children compared with subsequent children (9% vs 3%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.48-17.85). Index children lived in households with lower incomes relative to the federal poverty level than did subsequent children (101% vs 132% of federal poverty level; adjusted regression coefficient, –0.31; 95% CI, –0.52 to –0.10), and were more likely to live in households without enough money to pay for basic living expenses (72% vs 55%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.16; 95% CI, 2.34-11.40). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that access to abortion enables women to choose to have children at a time when they have more financial and emotional resources to devote to their children.",

        "abstract": "Contrary to the popular view that the U.S. welfare system has been in a contractionary phase after the expansions of the welfare state in the 1960s, welfare spending resumed steady growth after a pause in the 1970s. However, although aggregate spending is higher than ever, there have been redistributions away from non-elderly and nondisabled families to families with older adults and to families with recipients of disability programs; from non-elderly, nondisabled single-parent families to married-parent families; and from the poorest families to those with higher incomes. These redistributions likely reflect long-standing, and perhaps increasing, conceptualizations by U.S. society of which poor are deserving and which are not.",

        "abstract": "The formulation of the triple aim responds to three problems facing the US health care system: high cost, low quality, and poor health status. The purpose of this article is to analyze the potential of the health care system to achieve the triple aim and, specifically, the attempt to improve population health by rewarding providers who contain costs. The first section of the article will consider the task of improving population health through the health care system. The second section of the article will discuss CMS's efforts to pay providers to achieve the triple aim, that is, to improve health care and population health while containing cost. These include Maryland's Global Revenue Budget model, bundled payments, and ACOs, and they highlight the extent to which this version of integration is underwritten by savings achieved by providers for the Medicare program. The conclusion section of the article will consider the politics of payment reform as social reform. It will address proposals that health care payers and providers lead in addressing the social contributors to ill health and urge payment reformers to appreciate more fully the politics and policies of other sectors and the dynamics of their inclusion in population health improvement.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe cost of diapering an infant can place a significant financial strain on families living in poverty. Partnerships between diaper banks and home visiting programs for young families may offer an innovative solution to expanding the reach and impact of diaper banks in low-income communities. The purpose of this pilot study was to uncover preliminary information about the functions of diaper distribution through home visiting programs, and to inform future research and policy questions regarding diaper distribution to families in need.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SAMPLE\nIn this descriptive qualitative pilot study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 6 home visitors from Minding the Baby® (MTB), a home visiting intervention for young parents. MTB clinicians routinely distribute diapers in partnership with The Diaper Bank in Connecticut. We used directed content analysis to code and analyze interview transcripts.\n\n\nRESULTS/CONCLUSION\nThese preliminary findings indicate that partnerships between home visiting programs and diaper banks may benefit families by improving diaper access, reducing stigma, and fostering trusting relationships with home visitors. Home visiting program benefits including engagement or re-engagement with families may need to be balanced with potential effects on clinical and therapeutic relationships. Recommendations for next steps in research and related policy questions are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Some of the rapid recent growth in disability income receipt in the United States is attributable to single mothers post-welfare reform. Yet, we know little about how disability benefit receipt affects the economic well-being of single mother families, or how unsuccessful disability applicants fare. We compare disability recipients to unsuccessful applicants and those who never applied among current and former welfare recipients, and examine how application and receipt affect material hardships and subjective measures of well-being. We then examine whether alternative ways of making ends meet mediate differences in well-being. After controlling for alternative sources of support, no significant differences in overall actual hardships or difficulty living on current income remained between the three groups. However, even after controlling for these strategies, unsuccessful applicants were significantly more likely to report that they expected hardships in the next two months. Our results suggest a pervasive level of economic insecurity among unsuccessful applicants.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nPrevention is the most cost-effective approach to promote population health, yet little is known about the delivery of health promotion interventions in the nation's largest Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. The purpose of this study was to inventory health promotion interventions delivered through Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans; identify attributes of the interventions that plans judged to have the greatest impact on their members; and determine the extent to which the plans refer members to community assistance programs and sponsor health-promoting community activities.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe lead health educator from each managed care plan was asked to complete a 190-item online survey in January 2013; 20 of 21 managed care plans responded. Survey data on the health promotion interventions with the greatest impact were grouped according to intervention attributes and measures of effectiveness; quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHealth promotion interventions judged to have the greatest impact on Medi-Cal members were delivered in various ways; educational materials, one-on-one education, and group classes were delivered most frequently. Behavior change, knowledge gain, and improved disease management were cited most often as measures of effectiveness. Across all interventions, median educational hours were limited (2.4 h), and median Medi-Cal member participation was low (265 members per intervention). Most interventions with greatest impact (120 of 137 [88%]) focused on tertiary prevention. There were mixed results in referring members to community assistance programs and investing in community activities.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nManaged care plans have many opportunities to more effectively deliver health promotion interventions. Establishing measurable, evidence-based, consensus standards for such programs could facilitate improved delivery of these services.",

        "abstract": "Farmworkers experience pervasive economic insecurity in part because of the seasonal nature of agricultural work and limited employment protections. Yet little is known about the adequacy of the social safety net in responding to farmworker needs. Using data from the 2005-2009 National Agricultural Workers Survey (N = 10,469), the current study analyzed predictors of social welfare participation among Latinos, who represent approximately 80 percent of all farmworkers. Nearly 95 percent are immigrants, although almost half of them have lived in the United States for more than 10 years. Descriptive analyses showed that, even among farmworker households whose income fell below the poverty line or that were headed by legally documented individuals, social services use was very low. Logistic regression analyses revealed that degree of social integration influenced social welfare participation, controlling for education, poverty status, family composition, and employment characteristics. Latino farmworkers who were recent immigrants (that is, in the United States for less than five years) had significantly lower odds of access to social insurance and public assistance programs relative to their U.S.-born counterparts. Low self-reported English ability significantly decreased access to most social insurance programs but not public assistance receipt. The findings indicate the need for social workers to engage in outreach efforts and policy advocacy to improve farmworkers access to social welfare.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nReceipt of housing assistance from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is associated with improved health among adults and lower rates of unmet medical need among adults and young children. However, it is unclear whether HUD housing assistance is associated with healthier behaviors. The objective of our study was to assess whether participation in HUD housing assistance programs is associated with increased physical activity among low-income adults.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn 2017, we pooled cross-sectional data from the 2004-2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) linked to administrative records of HUD housing assistance participation. Our primary sample was low-income adults (aged ≥18; <200% of federal poverty level). Using multivariate logistic regression, we calculated the odds of being physically active (≥150 min/week of moderate-intensity activity or equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity) among current HUD housing assistance residents compared with a control group of future residents (adults who would receive assistance within the next 2 years). In a secondary analyses, we examined neighborhood socioeconomic status as a modifier and conducted a subanalysis among nonsenior adults (aged <65).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong all low-income adults, the adjusted odds of being physically active were similar for current and future residents (odds ratio =1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.46). Among nonseniors, current residents were more likely to be physically active than future residents (odds ratio = 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.97). Associations did not differ by neighborhood socioeconomic status.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nReceiving HUD housing assistance is associated with being physically active among nonsenior low-income adults.",

        "abstract": "Socioeconomic status (SES) has an important effect on health. Individuals with lower SES experience more chronic disease, are less likely to receive preventive care, and have shorter life expectancies. As the Affordable Care Act is implemented and increasing numbers of previously uninsured people gain access to health care, the imperative to recognize patients’ SES and develop health initiatives that account for the social determinants of health increases. Health care providers across the nation are adopting electronic health records (EHRs). Policies such as Meaningful Use offer opportunities systematically to incorporate the collection of standardized SES indicators into EHRs in ways that improve health, increase the understanding of the relationship between SES and health, and inform future policies. This paper examines the use of SES indicators in research, national surveys, and federal programs and finds adding an income question is the most feasible and optimal SES indicator for the inclusion in EHRs.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To date, little is known regarding the impact of maternal depression on participation in public benefit programs. This study examines whether maternal depression is predictive of lower WIC participation in early childhood. Methods This was a secondary data analysis using weighted data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort. Maternal data collected when children were 9 and 24 months of age were used. 9 months was considered baseline, and 24 months was considered follow-up. The study cohort consisted of 3841 low income mothers, defined as <185 % federal poverty level, who reported WIC participation at baseline. Baseline maternal depressive symptoms were measured by a 12-item abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. WIC participation was assessed by maternal self-report. Results At baseline, 24.5 % of mothers were depressed (raw score >9). The majority of mothers were white, unemployed, and born in the US. Most received Medicaid (74 %) and almost half received SNAP (47 %). At follow-up, 80.1 % of mothers reported WIC participation. In multivariable analysis, maternal depression at baseline was significantly associated with decreased WIC participation at follow-up (aOR 0.74; 95 % CI 0.55–0.99). Conclusions Our results suggest that maternal depression is an independent risk factor for decreased WIC participation in low-income families with young children. Primary and secondary prevention strategies aimed at maternal depression may positively impact low-income families’ participation in public benefit programs. Further longitudinal and interventional studies are needed in order to inform clinical practice and public health policy.",

        "abstract": "During the mid-1960s, the United States adopted a series of cash and in-kind transfer programs, as well as human capital investment strategies, as part of the War on Poverty. A number of other programs were first proposed as part of this \"war\" but were not implemented until the mid-1970s. These programs had noble goals: to increase incomes at the bottom of the income distribution, reduce poverty, and improve nutrition, heath, and human capital. However, various features of the programs also had the potential to produce unintended consequences: for example, means-tested programs can discourage work. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the main War on Poverty programs that were aimed at the low-income nonelderly population along with several follow-on programs. We focus on both intended and unintended consequences, drawing on the most compelling causal evidence. We conclude with a series of lessons learned and questions that are outstanding.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nWe studied whether use of farm-to-consumer (FTC) retail outlets (eg, farmers market, farm/roadside stand) was associated with daily fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake or obesity status among women who participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in Birmingham, AL.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used a cross-sectional study design and recruited a convenience sample of 312 women (mean age = 27.6; 67.0% non-Hispanic black; 45.6% obese) participating in Birmingham's WIC Program. Participants were recruited between October 2014 and January 2015. Participants who self-reported purchasing produce from a FTC outlet during the 2014 farmers' market season were classified as FTC outlet users. Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to examine associations between FTC outlet use, daily F&V intake, and obesity status (ie, body mass index ≥ 30).\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately 26.1% of participants were classified as FTC outlet users. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and WIC Cash Value Voucher redemption, FTC outlet use was associated with increased odds of consuming ≥ 5 servings of F&Vs per day (OR: 2.01; 95%: 1.15 - 3.50), but not obesity status (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.39 - 1.20).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFTC retail outlet use was associated with F&V intake among program participants but not obesity status.",

        "abstract": "Social and geographic displacement is a global phenomenon that precipitates novel stressors and disruptions that intersect with long-standing familial and social roles. Among the displaced are war-torn Iraqi refugee families, who must address these new obstacles in unconventional ways. This study explores how such disruptions have influenced associations between gender and apparent self-worth experienced by Iraqi refugee families upon relocation to the USA. Further, the psychosocial mechanisms requisite of any novel approach to a new social construct are explored and reveal that production in the family is at the core of instability and shifting power dynamics during resettlement, preventing family members from “seeing the life” in the USA that they had envisioned prior to immigration. Over 200 semi-structured qualitative interviews with Iraqi participants and mental health providers were conducted over the course of the study, which demonstrate a plasticity among social roles in the family and community that transcends the notion of a simple role reversal, and illustrate the complex positionalities that families under stress must approximate during such physical and social displacement.",

        "abstract": "Children spend a considerable amount of time in preschools and child care centers. As a result, these settings may have an influence on their diet, weight, and food security, and are potentially important contexts for interventions to address nutritional health. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is one such intervention. No national study has compared nutrition-related outcomes of children in CACFP-participating centers to those of similar children in non-participating centers. We use a sample of four-year old children drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort to obtain estimates of associations between CACFP program participation and consumption of milk, fruits, vegetables, fast food, and sweets, and indicators of overweight, underweight status and food insecurity. We find that, among low-income children, CACFP participation moderately increases consumption of milk and vegetables, and may also reduce the prevalence of overweight and underweight. Effects on other outcomes are generally small and not statistically significant.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nPublic funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program has never been sufficient to serve more than a small minority of income-eligible households. Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding has not increased with recent rapidly rising energy costs, harsh winter conditions, or higher child poverty rates. Although a national performance goal for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is to increase the percentage of recipient households having > or = 1 member < or = 5 years of age, the association of income-eligible households' receipt of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program with indicators of well-being in young children has not been evaluated previously. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the association between a family's participation or nonparticipation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and the anthropometric status and health of their young children.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn the ongoing Children's Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Project from June 1998 through December 2004, caregivers with children < 3 years of age in 2 emergency departments and 3 primary care clinics in 5 urban sites participated in cross-sectional surveys regarding household demographics, child's lifetime history of hospitalizations, and, for the past 12 months, household public assistance program participation and household food insecurity, measured by the US Food Security Scale. This scale, in accordance with established procedures, classifies households as food insecure if they report that they cannot afford enough nutritious food for all of the members to lead active, healthy lives. On the day of the interview, children's weight, length, and whether the children were admitted acutely to the hospital from the emergency departments were documented. The study sample consisted only of Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program income-eligible renter households without private insurance who also participated in > or = 1 other means-tested program.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this sample of 7074 caregivers, 16% of families received the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, similar to the national rate of 17%. Caregivers who received the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program were more likely to be single (63% vs 54%), US born (77% vs 68%), and older (mother's mean age: 28.1 vs 26.7 years) but were less likely to be employed (44% vs 47%). Households who received the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program were more likely to receive Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (85% vs 80%), Supplemental Security Income (13% vs 9%), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (38% vs 23%), and food stamps (59% vs 37%) and to live in subsidized housing (38% vs 19%) compared with nonrecipients. Children in families participating in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program were older than children in nonparticipating families (13.6 vs 12.5 months), were less likely to be uninsured (5% vs 9%), and were more likely to have had a low birth weight < or = 2500 g (17% vs 14%). Families participating in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program reported more household food insecurity (24% vs 20%) There were no significant group differences between recipients and nonrecipients in caregiver's education or child's gender. After controlling for these potentially confounding variables, including receipt of other means-tested programs, compared with children in recipient households, those in nonrecipient households had greater adjusted odds of being at aggregate nutritional risk for growth problems, defined as children with weight-for-age below the 5th percentile or weight-for-height below the 10th percentile, with significantly lower mean weight-for-age z scores calculated from age- and gender-specific values from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 reference data. However, in adjusted analyses, children aged 2 to 3 years in recipient households were not more likely to be overweight (BMI > 95th percentile) than those in nonrecipient households. Rates of age-adjusted lifetime hospitalization excluding birth and the day of the interview did not differ between Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program recipient groups. Among the 4445 of 7074 children evaluated in the 2 emergency departments, children from eligible households not receiving the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program had greater adjusted odds than those in recipient households of acute hospital admission on the day of the interview.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEven within a low-income renter sample, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program benefits seem to reach families at the highest social and medical risk with more food insecurity and higher rates of low birth-weight children. Nevertheless, after adjustment for differences in background risk, living in a household receiving the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is associated with less anthropometric evidence of undernutrition, no evidence of increased overweight, and lower odds of acute hospitalization from an emergency department visit among young children in low-income renter households compared with children in comparable households not receiving the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program in many states shuts down early each winter when their funding is exhausted. From a clinical perspective, pediatric health providers caring for children from impoverished families should consider encouraging families of these children to apply for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program early in the season before funding is depleted. From a public policy perspective, although this cross-sectional study design can only demonstrate associations and not causation, these findings suggest that, particularly as fuel costs and children's poverty rates increase, expanding the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding and meeting the national Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program performance goal of increasing the percentage of recipient households with young children might potentially benefit such children's growth and health.",

Food security status was assessed with USDA's 10-item adult Food Security Survey Module. Self-reported information about sleep duration, sleep latency, and sleep complaints to a health care professional were used as sleep outcomes. Multiple linear, stratified by sex, and logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between food security status and the 3 sleep outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nVery low food secure (FS) women reported significantly shorter sleep duration than fully FS women (difference: -30 ± 5.2 min; P < 0.01); however, no relation to sleep duration was observed among men. Among men, participants who were marginally FS (4 ± 1.1 min), low FS (4 ± 1.7 min), and very low FS (5 ± 1.8 min) reported significantly longer sleep latency than fully FS men (P < 0.05), but no association with sleep latency was observed among women. The divergent patterns in sleep duration and latency were likely because of our reference groups reporting undesirable sleep outcomes; fully FS men reported inadequate sleep and fully FS women reported long sleep latency. Among both men and women, marginally FS (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.16), low FS (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.30), and very low FS (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.36, 2.92) participants were more likely to report sleep complaints than their fully FS counterparts (P < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPoor sleep quantity and quality may predispose FI adults to adverse health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Although financial incentives are a well-accepted strategy for raising parent participation rates in prevention studies, they are rarely employed in practice due to concerns about their ethics, sustainability, and public acceptability. We sought to address these common concerns in the context of a larger prevention study using financial incentives to boost parent participation in a group-based parenting program implemented in an urban school district. We examined the extent to which the financial incentives delivered via bank debit cards ($15 for attending weekly group sessions, $5 for completing weekly practice assignments) motivated parents to enroll in the program and were associated with higher attendance and practice completion but poorer participation quality in group sessions, and how parents used the extra cash. Over 3 years, 67.4% (n = 372) of eligible families enrolled in a parenting program called the Chicago Parent Program. Most parents were African American (68%) or Latinx (24%); 67% reported annual household incomes < $20,000. Although 71.2% of parents reported that the financial incentives motivated their enrollment, the most important motivators pertained to wanting to be a better parent. Parents citing incentives as motivating their enrollment had higher attendance than those who did not (p = .01). Quality of parent participation was high and unrelated to whether financial incentives motivated enrollment. Parents reported using the extra cash to purchase items for their children (92%) and groceries (56%). Results suggest that financial incentives targeting low-income families of young children may improve parent participation rates without diminishing their intrinsic motivation to improve their parenting.",

We use the 2009 American Community Survey to model pre-ACA eligibility for comprehensive Medicaid coverage among nonelderly adults. We identify 4.5 million eligible but uninsured adults. We find a Medicaid participation rate of 67% for adults; the rate is 17 percentage points lower than the national Medicaid participation rate for children, and it varies substantially across socioeconomic and demographic subgroups and across states. Achieving substantial increases in coverage under the ACA will require sharp increases in Medicaid participation among adults in some states.",

In light of growing research in this area and the intense policy focus on coverage expansions in the United States, there is need for an up-to-date and comprehensive literature review and synthesis of lessons learned. We reviewed 112 experimental or quasi-experimental studies on the effects of health insurance prior to people becoming eligible for Medicare on a broad set of outcomes. Over the past decade, evidence related to the effect of increased access to health insurance has strengthened, illuminating that children and vulnerable adults are most likely to see health and economic benefits. We identified promising areas for future study in this active and burgeoning research area, noting benefit design of health insurance and outcomes such as government program participation and self-reported health status as targets.",

She had gone to the emergency department 3 times in the 10 days before the appointment for cough and difficulty breathing. Each time, she was given nebulizer treatments, improved, and was discharged home. She was also treated with oral corticosteroids and azithromycin. Her symptoms have persisted up to the day of the appointment. Her mother reports complete compliance with her inhaled medications, oral corticosteroids, and antibiotic. On further questioning, her mother reports that she, the patient, and the patient’s younger brother are living in a shelter. …",

        "abstract": "Rising rates of nonmarital childbirth in the United States have resulted in a new family type, the fragile family. Such families, which include cohabiting couples as well as single mothers, experience significantly higher rates of poverty and material hardship than their married counterparts. Ariel Kalil and Rebecca Ryan summarize the economic challenges facing mothers in fragile families and describe the resources, both public and private, that help them meet these challenges. The authors explain that the economic fragility of these families stems from both mothers' and fathers' low earnings, which result from low education levels, as well as from physical, emotional, and mental health problems. Mothers in fragile families make ends meet in many ways. The authors show that various public programs, particularly those that provide in-kind assistance, do successfully lessen economic hardship in fragile families. Single mothers also turn to private sources of support--friends, family, boyfriends--for cash and in-kind assistance. But though these private safety nets are essential to many mothers' economic survival, according to the authors, private safety nets are not always consistent and dependable. Thus, assistance from private sources may not fundamentally improve mothers' economic circumstances. Policy makers, say Kalil and Ryan, must recognize that with rates of nonmarital childbirth at their current level, and potentially rising still, the fragile family is likely an enduring fixture in this country. It is thus essential to strengthen policies that both support these families' economic self-sufficiency and alleviate their hardship during inevitable times of economic distress. The most important first step, they say, is to strengthen the public safety net, especially such in-kind benefits as food stamps, Medicaid, housing, and child care. A next step would be to bolster community-based programs that can provide private financial support, such as emergency cash assistance, child care, and food aid, when mothers cannot receive it from their own private networks.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nInfants are at risk of overweight. Infant overweight predisposes child, adolescent, and adult to obesity. We hypothesized that parent education, initiated prenatally and provided in the home, would reduce the incidence of infant overweight at age 12 months.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPregnant obese Latina women were recruited at Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and randomized to intervention versus control. Intervention subjects received home visits by trained Spanish-fluent community health workers who provided counseling on infant growth, breastfeeding, nutrition, child development, sleep, physical activity, and safety. Promotoras did not visit the control subjects. A research assistant collected outcome data on all subjects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to controls, parent education did not reduce infant overweight. Infant overweight developed rapidly and was present in 46% of infants by age 6 months. Infants overweight at 6 months were likely to be overweight at age 12 months (r = 0.60, P < .0001). Overweight was more common in formula-fed infants at ages 6 months (P < .06) and 12 months (P = .005). Breastfeeding was less common in families with employed mothers (P = .02) and unemployed fathers (P < .01), but the father living with the mother at the time of the prenatal visit predicted successful breastfeeding at infant age 2 months (P < .003). Compared to formula feeding, overweight at age 12 months was 2.7 times less likely for infants breastfed for ≥2 months (P = .01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe lack of success of the intervention may be explained in part by a high cesarean section rate in the intervention group, food and employment insecurity, and confounding by WIC breastfeeding promotion, which was available to all mothers. Breastfeeding was the most important mediator of infant overweight. The study supports efforts by WIC to vigorously promote breastfeeding.",

        "abstract": "As a major public health issue, human trafficking (HT) affects individuals, families, communities, and societies around the world. A public health approach to combating HT has been advocated. Such an approach seeks to prevent HT by engaging diverse stakeholder groups in addressing risk factors at multiple levels. As a key stakeholder group, health care professionals (HCPs) play a critical role in HT prevention. Herein, we use the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Social-Ecological Model as a framework to present potential HT prevention strategies for health care professionals. As clinicians, HCPs may deliver tailored interventions to patients and families to address individual- and relationship-level risk factors for HT in the health care setting. As educators, advocates, and researchers, HCPs may collaborate across sectors to implement community- and society-level prevention strategies. Such strategies may include enhancing awareness of HT through education; advocating for local and national policies that promote community health and wellness; combating social or cultural norms that contribute to HT; and building a strong evidence-base to guide future HT prevention programs. Guided by the CDC Social-Ecological Model, we recommend that HCPs use their diverse skills to target risk factors for HT at multiple levels and thereby expand their impact in preventing this form of exploitation.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to (1) measure health insurance coverage and continuity across generational subgroups of Latino children, and (2) determine if participation in public benefit programs is associated with increased health insurance coverage and continuity. We analyzed data on 25,388 children income-eligible for public insurance from the 2003 to 2004 National Survey of Children’s Health and stratified Latinos by generational status. First- and second-generation Latino children were more likely to be uninsured (58 and 19%, respectively) than third-generation children (9.5%). Second-generation Latino children were similarly likely to be currently insured by public insurance as third-generation children (61 and 62%, respectively), but less likely to have private insurance (19 and 29%, respectively). Second-generation Latino children were slightly more likely than third-generation children to have discontinuous insurance during the year (19 and 15%, respectively). Compared with children in families where English was the primary home language, children in families where English was not the primary home language had higher odds of being uninsured versus having continuous insurance coverage (OR: 2.19; 95% CI [1.33–3.62]). Among second-generation Latino children, participation in the Food Stamp (OR 0.26; 95% CI [0.14–0.48]) or Women, Infants, and Children (OR 0.40; 95% CI [0.25–0.66]) programs was associated with reduced odds of being uninsured. Insurance disparities are concentrated among first- and second-generation Latino children. For second-generation Latino children, connection to other public benefit programs may promote enrollment in public insurance.",

        "abstract": "The use of short-term rental subsidy vouchers offers a new approach to addressing the housing needs of families facing homelessness. In Massachusetts, the Family Home pilot program placed homeless families in housing instead of shelter, providing two years of rental subsidy plus support services with the goal of enabling families to maintain market rate housing. This mixed-method case study complements staff and participant interview data with participant survey and administrative data to evaluate the implementation and short-term outcomes of Family Home in one region. Data point to improved family well-being in housing but also persistent barriers to achieving longer-term housing and economic stability. Of the families who had exited the program at the end of the study, one quarter were able to retain their housing at market rate, only 9% returned to shelter, and one in five moved in with families/friends. Lack of affordable housing in a high rental cost region and jobs that pay living wages were among the major reasons that families struggled to maintain housing. This research points to the need for integrating supportive services from the program's start, including targeted workforce development, to plan for the end of the short-term rental subsidy.",

        "abstract": "Recent policy attempts to set high nutrition standards for the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) aim to improve children's health outcomes. A timely and policy-relevant task evaluates to what extent school meal programs contribute to child body mass index (BMI) outcomes to assess those school meal policies' potential impacts. This study examines children's weight progress from 1st through 8th grade, while recognizing the potential effects on those children participating in both programs compared with those children participating in only one program. We used difference-in-differences (DID) and average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) methodologies and focused on free- and reduced-price meal-eligible children to filter out income effects. The DID results show that short-term participation in only NSLP increases the probability that children will be overweight, and these results are more prominent in the South, Northeast, and rural areas. ATT results show that participation in both programs from 1st through 8th grade increases the probability that these students will be overweight. With the Community Eligibility Provision having taken effect across the nation in the 2014-2015 school year, the need to continue examining the impacts of these programs on child BMI is even greater.

        "abstract": "The social safety net responded in significant and favorable ways during the Great Recession. Aggregate per capita expenditures grew significantly, with particularly strong growth in the SNAP, EITC, UI, and Medicaid programs. Distributionally, the increase in transfers was widely shared across demographic groups, including families with and without children, single-parent and two-parent families. Transfers grew as well among families with more employed members and with fewer employed members. However, the increase in transfer amounts was not strongly progressive across income classes within the low-income population, increasingly slightly more for those just below the poverty line and those just above it, compared to those at the bottom of the income distribution. This is mainly the result of the EITC program, which provides greater benefits to those with higher family earnings. The expansions of SNAP and UI benefitted those at the bottom of the income distribution to a greater extent.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the effect of a clinic-based screening and referral system (Well Child Care, Evaluation, Community Resources, Advocacy, Referral, Education [WE CARE]) on families' receipt of community-based resources for unmet basic needs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial at 8 urban community health centers, recruiting mothers of healthy infants. In the 4 WE CARE clinics, mothers completed a self-report screening instrument that assessed needs for child care, education, employment, food security, household heat, and housing. Providers made referrals for families; staff provided requisite applications and telephoned referred mothers within 1 month. Families at the 4 control community health centers received the usual care. We analyzed the results with generalized mixed-effect models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree hundred thirty-six mothers were enrolled in the study (168 per arm). The majority of families had household incomes <$20,000 (57%), and 68% had ≥ 2 unmet basic needs. More WE CARE mothers received ≥ 1 referral at the index visit (70% vs 8%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 29.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.7-59.6). At the 12-month visit, more WE CARE mothers had enrolled in a new community resource (39% vs 24%; aOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7). WE CARE mothers had greater odds of being employed (aOR = 44.4; 95% CI, 9.8-201.4). WE CARE children had greater odds of being in child care (aOR = 6.3; 95% CI, 1.5-26.0). WE CARE families had greater odds of receiving fuel assistance (aOR = 11.9; 95% CI, 1.7-82.9) and lower odds of being in a homeless shelter (aOR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSystematically screening and referring for social determinants during well child care can lead to the receipt of more community resources for families.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe Social Ecological Model (SEM) has been used to describe the aetiology of childhood obesity and to develop a framework for prevention. The current paper applies the SEM to data collected at multiple levels, representing different layers of the SEM, and examines the unique and relative contribution of each layer to children's weight status.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional survey of randomly selected households with children living in low-income diverse communities.\n\n\nSETTING\nA telephone survey conducted in 2009-2010 collected information on parental perceptions of their neighbourhoods, and household, parent and child demographic characteristics. Parents provided measured height and weight data for their children. Geocoded data were used to calculate proximity of a child's residence to food and physical activity outlets.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nAnalysis based on 560 children whose parents participated in the survey and provided measured heights and weights.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMultiple logistic regression models were estimated to determine the joint contribution of elements within each layer of the SEM as well as the relative contribution of each layer. Layers of the SEM representing parental perceptions of their neighbourhoods, parent demographics and neighbourhood characteristics made the strongest contributions to predicting whether a child was overweight or obese. Layers of the SEM representing food and physical activity environments made smaller, but still significant, contributions to predicting children's weight status.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe approach used herein supports using the SEM for predicting child weight status and uncovers some of the most promising domains and strategies for childhood obesity prevention that can be used for designing interventions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nHomelessness is associated with worse diabetes outcomes, but the relationship between other forms of unstable housing and diabetes is not well studied. We assessed whether unstable housing was associated with increased risk for diabetes-related emergency department use or hospitalization.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe used data from the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey (HCPS), a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of patients who receive care at federally funded safety-net health centers. We included nonhomeless adults (aged ≥18 years) with self-reported diabetes. Unstable housing was defined as not having enough money to pay rent or mortgage, moving two or more times in the past 12 months, or staying at a place one does not own or rent. The primary outcome was self-report of diabetes-related emergency department visit or inpatient hospitalization in the last 12 months. We also examined use of housing assistance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,087 participants, representing 3,277,165 adults with diabetes, 37% were unstably housed. Overall, 13.7% of participants reported a diabetes-related emergency department visit or hospitalization in the past year. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for multiple potential confounders, unstable housing was associated with greater odds of diabetes-related emergency department use or hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio 5.17 [95% CI 2.08-12.87]). Only 0.9% of unstably housed individuals reported receiving help with housing through their clinic.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnstable housing is common and associated with increased risk of diabetes-related emergency department and inpatient use. Addressing unstable housing in clinical settings may help improve health care utilization for vulnerable individuals with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This investigation sought to identify the physical activity (PA) terms and concepts that are best understood by low‐income adults. Design: This was a cross‐sectional study using semistructured cognitive interviews that employed retrospective verbal probing techniques. Setting: Interviews were conducted in Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) sites in New Jersey, Tennessee, and Washington. Participants: A convenience sample of 57 adults participating in or eligible for participation in EFNEP. Phenomenon of Interest: Participants' interpretations and conceptualizations of PA concepts and terms. Analysis: Template and constant comparative analysis. Results: Participants interpreted many PA terms and concepts in unintended ways. Exercise was the term that came closest to conveying moderate to vigorous PA. Terms used to describe muscle‐strengthening activities were mostly understood. Intentional engagement in extra activities was difficult for participants to conceptualize despite multiple tested wordings; making small changes to be active came closest to conveying this concept. Participants' comprehension of the PA terms differed by their PA and literacy levels. Conclusions and Implications: Nutrition educators should be mindful of the terminologies they used in communicating messages and assessing PA behaviors to EFNEP participants or similar populations.",

This fact in itself shows how much things have changed for progressives since TANF was enacted in 1996. Now nearly everyone agrees that work should be the major emphasis of the TANF program and that a major role of government is to supplement the income of low-skilled mothers who work but usually earn low wages. Since creation of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in 1975, Congress has enacted numerous pieces of legislation to strengthen the work-based safety net. The result is that low-income working families with children are eligible for SNAP (food stamps) and other nutrition benefits, the EITC, the Additional Child Tax Credit and their children are covered by Medicaid. In addition, these families are eligible for housing benefits, Head Start, state preschool programs, and day care subsidies, although not all families receive these benefits because Congress and the states do not appropriate enough money to cover all eligible families. Although there’s a gap between coverage and need, the work-based safety net still provides an impressive array of benefits to working families with children. Low-income working families with children receive more help from government than ever before—and there is bipartisan agreement that this is good policy. As I presented in Figure 1 of my original paper, these benefits cut the poverty rate among low-income working families with children, mostly headed by females, by a little less than half. Although the work rate of single mothers has fluctuated since reaching its peak in the booming economy of the 1990s, the recessions of 2001 and 2007 to 2009 temporarily lowered work rates. Still, just as would be expected from adults who are attached to the work force, the work rate among single mothers with children has tracked broader macroeconomic performance. Even when work rates decline during tough economic times, they are still higher than during the pre-welfare reform era and, equally important, poverty rates among black children and all children in female-headed families are lower. The emphasis on work from welfare reform and the work-based safety net both contribute to the increase in work and the decline in poverty over the last two decades. Danziger et al. would not necessarily disagree with this analysis, but they would argue that TANF could be greatly improved if more poor families received TANF cash benefits. Their main criticism of welfare reform is that TANF is no longer an entitlement under which everyone who meets the income and assets standards is guaranteed a cash benefit. They hold that the end of entitlement cash benefits means that the work-based safety net is “incomplete.” This criticism goes to the heart of what Republicans did with the 1996 welfare reform law. Their explicit intent was to end the entitlement, as stated flatly in Section 401 of the Social Security Act, which established the TANF program. The primary reason Republicans ended the entitlement was that they believed too many able-bodied adults were dependent on welfare. The most controversial features of their bill—the end of entitlement, the work requirements, and the sanctions—were all intended to encourage, cajole,",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA critical shortage of affordable housing for low-income families continues in the United States. Children in households that are food insecure are at high risk for adverse nutritional and health outcomes and thus may be more vulnerable to the economic pressures exerted by high housing costs. Only about one fourth of eligible families receive a federally financed housing subsidy. Few studies have examined the effects of such housing subsidies on the health and nutritional status of low-income children.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the relationship between receiving housing subsidies and nutritional and health status among young children in low-income families, especially those that are food insecure.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional observational study.\n\n\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS\nFrom August 1998 to June 2003, the Children's Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program interviewed caregivers of children younger than 3 years in pediatric clinics and emergency departments in 6 sites (Arkansas, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Washington, DC). Interviews included demographics, perceived child health, the US Household Food Security Scale, and public assistance program participation. Children's weight at the time of the visit was documented. The study sample consisted of all renter households identified as low income by their participation in at least 1 means-tested program.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWeight for age, self-reported child health status, and history of hospitalization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nData were available for 11 723 low-income renter families; 27% were receiving a public housing subsidy, and 24% were food insecure. In multivariable analyses, stratified by household food security status and adjusted for potential confounding variables, children of food-insecure families not receiving housing subsidies had lower weight for age (adjusted mean z score, -0.025 vs 0.205; P<.001) compared with children of food-insecure families receiving housing subsidies. Compared with children in food-insecure, subsidized families, the adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for weight-for-age z score more than 2 SDs below the mean was 2.11 (1.34-3.32) for children in food-insecure, nonsubsidized families.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a large convenience sentinel sample, the children of low-income renter families who receive public housing subsidies are less likely to have anthropometric indications of undernutrition than those of comparable families not receiving housing subsidies, especially if the family is not only low income but also food insecure.",

        "abstract": "It is important to understand adult outcomes in childhood obesity prevention programs as parents and caregivers have a significant influence on the eating and physical activity habits of youth. Grounded in the social cognitive theory, the iCook 4-H study was centered on a dyad model (9-10 year-olds and their primary meal preparers) to teach healthy cooking skills, shopping and meal habits, and being active as a family. The program took place in five states and dyads (n = 54) were recruited through flyers, e-mails, and in-person contact. The focus of this article is to provide findings from adult program participants. Demographics and self-reported food intake, procurement, preparation and safety practices, feeding relationships, mealtime routines, and height and weight were collected through surveys at baseline and program completion, which spanned 3 months. Descriptive statistics including two-related samples tests and paired samples t tests were used to assess pre- and post-program survey data responses at p < 0.05 significance level. Most had a bachelor's degree (31%) or some college (29%), about half were white, 66% were married, about 30% of households participated in assistance programs, and 82% were female. At program conclusion, participants significantly improved meal planning, prioritizing healthy meal choices, shopping with a grocery list, and reading Nutrition Facts Labels. There were also significant, positive differences noted in cooking skill confidence (p = 0.015), desire to cook more meals at home, and fewer fast food meals. Adult-youth feeding interactions also significantly improved. There were also significant increases in fruit juice (100%), vegetable soup, and whole grain consumption. Based on results, adults reported improvements in meal planning, cooking, and purchasing skills that were taught in classes.",

        "abstract": "The geographic concentration of disadvantage is a key mechanism of inequity. In the United States, the spatial patterning of disadvantage renders it more than the sum of its individual parts and disproportionately harms economically and racially marginalized Americans. This article focuses specifically on the political effects of Medicaid beneficiaries being concentrated in particular locales. After offering a framework for conceptualizing the community-wide consequences of such policy concentration, I analyze aggregate multiyear data to examine the effect of Medicaid density on county-level voter turnout and local organizational strength. I find that, as the proportion of county residents enrolled in Medicaid increases, the prevalence of civic and political membership associations declines and aggregate rates of voting decrease. These results suggest that, if grassroots political action is to be part of a strategy to achieve health equity, policy makers and local organizations must make efforts to counteract the sometimes demobilizing \"place-based\" political effects of \"people-based\" policies such as Medicaid.",

Using data from studies of randomized controlled trials as well as real-world data, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate cost-effectiveness of Nurse-Family Partnership in a hypothetical cohort of first-born children in the United States. Analyses were conducted in 2015. Were all new mothers eligible for Nurse-Family Partnership, the program would produce 0.11 QALYs (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.06, 0.17) at an additional cost of $1,021 (95% CI=-$2,831, $4,414) per nurse-visited child's lifetime relative to the comparison-group children or $14,642 (95% CI = Savings, $71,877) per QALY gained. However, if applied to high-risk mothers, it would generate 0.19 QALYs (95% CI = 0.09, 0.44) and a net benefit of $2,764 (95% CI =-$1,210, $7,092) per nurse-visited child. Nurse-Family Partnership should be considered as a policy investment, particularly in an era of investments in the social determinants of health.",

        "abstract": "Whether executive functioning deficits result in children experiencing learning difficulties is presently unclear. Yet evidence for these hypothesized causal relations has many implications for early intervention design and delivery. We used a multi-year panel design, multiple criterion and predictor variable measures, extensive statistical control for potential confounds including autoregressive prior histories of both reading and mathematics difficulties, and additional epidemiological methods to preliminarily examine these hypothesized relations. Results from multivariate logistic regression analyses of a nationally representative and longitudinal sample of 18,080 children (i.e., the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort of 2011, or ECLS-K: 2011) indicated that working memory and, separately, cognitive flexibility deficits uniquely increased kindergarten children's risk of experiencing reading as well as mathematics difficulties in first grade. The risks associated with working memory deficits were particularly strong. Experimentally-evaluated, multi-component interventions designed to help young children with reading or mathematics difficulties may also need to remediate early deficits in executive function, particularly in working memory.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nHousehold energy security has not been measured empirically or related to child health and development but is an emerging concern for clinicians and researchers as energy costs increase. The objectives of this study were to develop a clinical indicator of household energy security and assess associations with food security, health, and developmental risk in children <36 months of age.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional study that used household survey and surveillance data was conducted. Caregivers were interviewed in emergency departments and primary care clinics form January 2001 through December 2006 on demographics, public assistance, food security, experience with heating/cooling and utilities, Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status, and child health. The household energy security indicator includes energy-secure, no energy problems; moderate energy insecurity, utility shutoff threatened in past year; and severe energy insecurity, heated with cooking stove, utility shutoff, or >or=1 day without heat/cooling in past year. The main outcome measures were household and child food security, child reported health status, Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status concerns, and hospitalizations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 9721 children, 11% (n = 1043) and 23% (n = 2293) experienced moderate and severe energy insecurity, respectively. Versus children with energy security, children with moderate energy insecurity had greater odds of household food insecurity, child food insecurity, hospitalization since birth, and caregiver report of child fair/poor health, adjusted for research site and mother, child, and household characteristics. Children with severe energy insecurity had greater adjusted odds of household food insecurity, child food insecurity, caregivers reporting significant developmental concerns on the Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status scale, and report of child fair/poor health. No significant association was found between energy security and child weight for age or weight for length.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs household energy insecurity increases, infants and toddlers experienced increased odds of household and child food insecurity and of reported poor health, hospitalizations, and developmental risks.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nData on health care costs for working-age adults with physical disabilities are sparse and the dynamic nature of disability is not captured.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effect of 3 types of disability status (persistent disability, temporary disability, and no disability) on health care expenditures, out-of-pocket (OOP) spending, and financial burden.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from Medical Expenditure Panel Survey panel 12 (2007-2008) were used. Respondents were classified into 3 groups. Medians of average annual expenditures, OOP expenditures, and financial ratios were weighted. The package R was used for quantile regression analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifteen percent of the working-age population reported persistent disabilities and 7% had temporary disabilities. The persistent disability group had the greatest unadjusted annual medians for total expenditures ($4234), OOP expenses ($591), and financial burden ratios (1.59), followed by the temporary disability group ($1612, $388, 0.71 respectively). The persistent disability group paid approximately 15% of total health care expenditures out-of-pocket, while the temporary disability group and the no disability group each paid 22% out-of-pocket. After adjusting for other factors, quantile regression shows that the persistent disability group had significantly higher total expenditures, OOP expenses, and financial burden ratios (coefficients 1664, 156, 0.58 respectively) relative to the no disability group at the 50th percentile. Results for the temporary disability group show a similar trend except for OOP expenses.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPeople who have disabling conditions for a longer period have better financial protection against OOP health care expenses but face greater financial burdens because of their higher out-of-pocket expenditures and their socioeconomic disadvantages.",

        "abstract": "Through five waves of data collection, this longitudinal study investigated the development of spatial skills in 304 elementary school children (Mage  = 7.64 years) as they progressed from the second to fourth grade. The study focused on whether multiple latent classes with different developmental profiles best explain development. Spatial skills were measured by tests featuring two-dimensional figures. Mathematics achievement was measured by the statewide end-of-year test and was included as a distal outcome variable. The role of covariates, including socioeconomic status, verbal working memory, and gender, was also explored. The results indicate a need to view two-dimensional spatial skills development as multidimensional with two developmental profiles predicted by socioeconomic status, verbal working memory, and gender. The developmental profiles predicted differences in mathematics achievement.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to measure the relative contribution of adverse experiences to adolescent behavioral health problems using administrative data. Specifically, we sought to understand the predictive value of adverse experiences on the presence of mental health and substance abuse problems for youth receiving publicly funded social and health services. Medicaid claims and other service records were analyzed for 125,123 youth age 12-17 and their biological parents. Measures from administrative records reflected presence of parental domestic violence, mental illness, substance abuse, criminal justice involvement, child abuse and/or neglect, homelessness, and death of a biological parent. Mental health and substance abuse status of adolescents were analyzed as functions of adverse experiences and other youth characteristics using logistic regression. In multivariate analyses, all predictors except parental domestic violence were statistically significant for substance abuse; parental death, parental mental illness, child abuse or neglect and homelessness were statistically significant for mental illness. Odds ratios for child abuse/neglect were particularly high in both models. The ability to identify risks during childhood using administrative data suggests the potential to target prevention and early intervention efforts for children with specific family risk factors who are at increased risk for developing behavioral health problems during adolescence. This study illustrates the utility of administrative data in understanding adverse experiences on children and the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.",

More than half of families were reported to CPS at some point, but less than one-fifth ever had a report substantiated. Reports that were uninvestigated or unfounded increased in the months leading up to shelter entry and spiked immediately afterward, but substantiations and child removals increased only later. Shelter use before study entry was associated with CPS referrals and investigations after study entry, although not with substantiated cases or child removals. However, CPS involvement before study entry was not associated with returns to shelter after study entry. These results imply that an unsubstantiated report of neglect or abuse may serve as an early warning signal for homelessness and that preventive strategies aiming to affect both homeless and child protective systems should focus on reducing homelessness. CPS workers should evaluate families' housing needs and attempt to link families to appropriate resources. Black families were disproportionately referred to CPS after shelter entry after controlling for other family characteristics, but race was not associated with substantiations of neglect or abuse or with child removals. Findings lend modest support to human decision-making and institutional explanations of racial disproportionalities in CPS involvement, especially for reporters outside of the CPS system.",

        "abstract": "Early childbearing is associated with a host of educational and economic disruptions for teenage girls and increased risk of adverse outcomes for their children. Low-income, maltreated, and foster youth have a higher risk of teen motherhood than the general population of youth. In this study, we assessed differences in the risk of early motherhood among these groups and investigated whether differences likely reflect selection factors versus effects of involvement with Child Protective Services (CPS) or foster care. Using a statewide linked administrative data system for Wisconsin, we employed survival analysis to estimate the hazard of early birth (child conceived prior to age 18) among females. We found that both the youth involved in CPS and youth in foster care were at significantly higher risk of early motherhood than low-income youth, and these differences were not explained by a range of sociodemographic and family composition characteristics. Moreover, our findings indicate that CPS and foster care are unlikely to be causal agents in the risk of early motherhood: among foster youth, risk was lower during foster care compared with before; among CPS-involved girls, risk was the same or lower after CPS investigation compared with before. Subsequent analysis showed that after girls exited foster care, those who were reunified with their birth families were at higher risk than those placed in adoption or guardianship. Overall, our findings suggest that whereas CPS and foster youth are high-risk populations for early motherhood, CPS involvement and foster care placement do not exacerbate, and may instead reduce, risk.",

        "abstract": "This retrospective reviews the policies that affect the fertility of American women, both policies designed to alter fertility intentionally as well as those that change childbearing unintentionally. Becker’s seminal work on the economics of fertility serves as the theoretical foundation for this literature. After describing Becker’s economic model, we review the empirical literature on fertility responses to social welfare policies, tax policies, the mandated health care coverage of infertility treatments, abortion policies, and government-sponsored family planning services. We also address several Supreme Court cases that have played an important role in the interpretation of these policies. Where relevant, this retrospective describes the distributional effects of these natalist policies. We also discuss the limitations of this literature and identify important gaps. Unlike most developed countries that have created strategies to increase fertility to support their ageing population, the United States spends considerably less time and thought on this issue. Our reading of the literature suggests that we have many public policies that have affected and continue to influence the fertility choices made by families in the United States and that this is a topical area that deserves more attention in policy debates.

        "abstract": "Mental health correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization including negative physical and mental health outcomes are well documented. However, certain subgroups of African American women, such as those living in impoverished, urban communities, are underrepresented in most studies and may experience IPV at higher rates. Furthermore, the circumstances of this women including poverty makes them at risk to IPV and its consequences. The present study estimated the prevalence of IPV victimization and its association with depression in a sample of low-income African American women participating in the Mobile Youth and Poverty Study. Participants in this study were caregivers of adolescents living in extremely impoverished conditions and were part of the Mobile Youth Survey, a community-based, longitudinal, multiple cohort survey conducted between the years 1998 and 2011. Data for the current study were collected between the years 2001 and 2010. The dependent variable was depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). The independent variable was IPV measured using a subsample of items from the Conflict Tactics Scale. Nearly three quarters (73.6%, n = 489) of the sample experienced some form of IPV and 49.1% ( n = 326) had a CES-D depression score of 16 or greater indicating mild to severe depression symptoms. The highest proportion of women who met the CES-D criteria for depression were those experiencing the most severe IPV irrespective of category (i.e., physical, psychological, or combined). Logistic regression analyses showed that women reporting the most severe abuse, irrespective of category, were significantly more likely to meet the CES-D criteria for depression. In addition, low education and receipt of economic assistance were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. The combination of poor economic conditions and IPV may predispose African American women living in impoverished, urban communities to mental health outcomes such as depression.",

        "abstract": "Summary:In recent decades, writes Wendy Manning, cohabitation has become a central part of the family landscape in the United States—so much so that by age 12, 40 percent of American children will have spent at least part of their lives in a cohabiting household. Although many children are born to cohabiting parents, and cohabiting families come in other forms as well, the most common cohabiting arrangement is a biological mother and a male partner.Cohabitation, Manning notes, is associated with several factors that have the potential to reduce children’s wellbeing. Cohabiting families are more likely than married families to be poor, and poverty harms children in many ways. Cohabiting parents also tend to have less formal education—a key indicator of both economic and social resources—than married parents do. And cohabiting parent families don’t have the same legal protections that married parent families have.Most importantly, cohabitation is often a marker of family instability, and family instability is strongly associated with poorer outcomes for children. Children born to cohabiting parents see their parents break up more often than do children born to married parents. In this way, being born into a cohabiting family sets the stage for later instability, and children who are born to cohabiting parents appear to experience enduring deficits of psychosocial wellbeing. On the other hand, stable cohabiting families with two biological parents seem to offer many of the same health, cognitive, and behavioral benefits that stable married biological parent families provide.Turning to stepfamilies, cohabitation’s effects are tied to a child’s age. Among young children, living in a cohabiting stepfamily rather than a married stepfamily is associated with more negative indicators of child wellbeing, but this is not so among adolescents. Thus the link between parental cohabitation and child wellbeing depends on both the type of cohabiting parent family and the age of the child.",

        "abstract": "This paper assesses the impact of welfare reform’s parental work requirements on low-income children’s cognitive and social-emotional development. The identification strategy exploits an important feature of the work requirement rules—namely, age-of youngest- child exemptions—as a source of quasi-experimental variation in first-year maternal employment. The 1996 welfare reform law empowered states to exempt adult recipients from the work requirements until the youngest child reaches a certain age. This led to substantial variation in the amount of time that mothers can remain home with a newborn child. I use this variation to estimate the impact of work-requirement induced increases in maternal employment. Using a sample of infants from the Birth cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, the reduced form and instrumental variables estimates reveal sizable negative effects of maternal employment. An auxiliary analysis of mechanisms finds that working mothers experience an increase in depressive symptoms, and are less likely to breastfeed and read to their children. In addition, such children are exposed to nonparental child care arrangements at a younger age, and they spend more time in these settings throughout the first year of life.",

This study uses data from two national birth cohort studies in the U.S., the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (N = ∼9400) from 2001 to 2003 and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 2458) from 1998 to 2003, to estimate the effects of poor infant health on child and household food insecurity and explore the potential buffering effects of public programs that provide food, healthcare, and cash assistance. We address the issue of causality by defining poor infant health as an unexpected shock and conducting relevant specification tests. We find convincing evidence that poor infant health does not affect food insecurity but that it greatly increases reliance on cash assistance for low-income individuals with disabilities, which appears to be playing a buffering role.",

        "abstract": "Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the March Current Population Survey, we provide poverty estimates for 1967 to 2012 based on a historical Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). During this period, poverty, as officially measured, has stagnated. However, the official poverty measure (OPM) does not account for the effect of near-cash transfers on the financial resources available to families, an important omission since such transfers have become an increasingly important part of government anti-poverty policy. Applying the historical SPM, which does count such transfers, we find that trends in poverty have been more favorable than the OPM suggests and that government policies have played an important and growing role in reducing poverty-a role that is not evident when the OPM is used to assess poverty. We also find that government programs have played a particularly important role in alleviating child poverty and deep poverty, especially during economic downturns.",

        "abstract": "Using a national sample of 1,461 child protective services (CPS) investigations in the United States, we examine differences between black and white families with regard to caseworker ratings of risk and harm to the child, as well as the probability that a case is substantiated for maltreatment. We employ difference-in-difference methods to identify whether gaps in outcomes for black and white families are equivalent when black and white CPS workers conduct the investigation, and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition methods to identify the portion of the black-white difference in outcomes that is attributable to differences in case characteristics (risk factors) versus differences in associations between these characteristics and the outcomes by race (differential treatment). We find no differences in outcomes by child race after adjusting for case characteristics. At the same time, we find that relative to white caseworkers, black caseworkers are more likely to rate black children at subjectively higher risk of harm than white children and are also more likely to substantiate black families for maltreatment. The decomposition results suggest that-even after accounting for caseworker race-differences in outcomes for black and white children are primarily explained by differences in family and case circumstances rather than differential treatment. Thus, our analyses suggest that interventions addressing maltreatment-related risk factors that disproportionately affect black families may have greater utility for reducing racial disparities in CPS involvement than current emphases on cultural competence training.",

In interviews with 55 teenage mothers in Colorado, we find that they are experiencing severe economic and social strains. Financially, although most are receiving substantial help from family members and sometimes their children’s fathers, basic needs often remain unmet. Macroeconomic and family structure trends have resulted in deprived material circumstances, while welfare reform and other changes have reduced the availability of aid. Socially, families’ and communities’ disapproval of early childbearing negatively influences the support young mothers receive, their social interactions, and their experiences with social institutions.",

Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, my difference-in-differences estimates indicate that the probability of being obese increased by 3 percentage points among children whose families experienced a greater income shock. A further investigation suggests that a reduction in maternal time with children played a greater role in children's weight gain than income. The paper's finding shows that a program that is not designed for health purposes, such as earned income tax credit, can have unintended effects on health outcomes.",

Access to potential (within 0.5 miles of household) and realized (where participant buys fruits and vegetables most often) food stores was assessed. Descriptive analyses revealed that participants lived closer to food stores not offering more than 5 fresh fruits and vegetables daily. Participants purchased fresh fruits and vegetables from food stores that were an average of 1.2 miles further than the closest food stores offering more than 5 fresh fruits and vegetables daily to their household. Results highlight complexities of the food environment and the need to further investigate factors influencing food-related behaviors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we comprehensively examine the effects of the Great Recession on child poverty, with particular attention to the role of the social safety net in mitigating the adverse effects of shocks to earnings and income. Using a state panel data model\nand data for 2000 to 2014, we estimate the relationship between the business cycle and child poverty, and we examine how and to what extent the safety net is providing protection to at-risk children. We find compelling evidence that the safety net provides protection; that is, the cyclicality of after-tax-and-transfer child poverty is significantly attenuated relative to the cyclicality of private income poverty. We also find that the protective effect of the safety net is not similar across demographic groups, and\nthat children from more disadvantaged backgrounds, such as those living with Hispanic or single heads, or particularly those living with immigrant household heads—or immigrant spouses—experience larger poverty cyclicality than those living with non-\nHispanic white or married heads, or those living with native household heads with native spouses. Our findings hold across a host of choices for how to define poverty. These include measures based on absolute thresholds or more relative thresholds. They also hold for measures of resources that include not only cash and near-cash transfers net of taxes but also several measures of the value of public medical benefits.",

        "abstract": "Assessing the impact of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) on household food insufficiency is critical to improve the implementation of public food assistance and to improve the nutrition intake of low-income children and their families. To examine the association of receiving free/reduced-price lunch from the NSLP with household food insufficiency among low-income children and their families in the United States, the study used data from four longitudinal panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP; 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2008), which collected information on household food insufficiency covering both summer and non-summer months. The sample included 15, 241 households with at least one child (aged 5-18) receiving free/reduced-price lunch from the NSLP. A dichotomous measure describes whether households have sufficient food to eat in the observed months. Fixed-effects regression analysis suggests that the food insufficiency rate is .7 (95%CI: .1, 1.2) percentage points higher in summer months among NSLP recipients. Since low-income families cannot participate in the NSLP in summer when the school is not in session, the result indicates the NSLP participation is associated with a reduction of food insufficiency risk by nearly 14%. The NSLP plays a significant role to protect low-income children and their families from food insufficiency. It is important to increase access to school meal programs among children at risk of food insufficiency in order to ensure adequate nutrition and to mitigate the health problems associated with malnourishment among children.",

        "abstract": "Poor pregnancy and birth outcomes are major problems in the United States, and maternal smoking during pregnancy has been identified as one of the most preventable risk factors associated with these outcomes. This study examines less explored risk factors of smoking among underserved African American pregnant women. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at an outpatient obstetrics-gynecology clinic of an inner-city university hospital in Virginia from March 2009 through January 2011 in which pregnant women (N = 902) were interviewed at their first prenatal care visit. Survey questions included items related to women’s sociodemographic characteristics as well as their pregnancy history; criminal history; receipt of social services; child protective services involvement; insurance status; and history of substance abuse, domestic violence, and depression. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to calculate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals depicting the relationship between these factors and smoking during pregnancy. The analysis reported that maternal age [OR = 1.08, 95 % CI = 1.05–1.12], less than high school education [OR = 4.30, 95 % CI = 2.27–8.14], unemployed [OR = 2.33, 95 % CI = 1.35–4.04], criminal history [OR = 1.66, 95 % CI = 1.05–2.63], receipt of social services [OR = 2.26, 95 % CI = 1.35–3.79] alcohol use [OR = 2.73, 95 % CI = 1.65–4.51] and illicit drug use [OR = 1.97, 95 % CI = 1.04–3.74] during pregnancy were statistically significant risk factors associated with smoking during pregnancy. In addition to the well known risk factors, public health professionals should be aware that criminal history and receipt of social services are important factors associated with smoking during pregnancy. Social service providers such as WIC and prisons and jails may offer a unique opportunity for education and cessation interventions during the preconception or interconception period.",

        "abstract": "Background\nDietary habits formed during the first 5 y of life portend lifelong eating patterns.\n\n\nObjective\nThe Synergistic Theory Research Obesity and Nutrition Group (STRONG) Kids 2 birth cohort study aimed to examine multilevel predictors of weight trajectories and dietary habits including individual biology, child socioemotional and behavioral characteristics, family environment, and child care environment over the first 5 y of life. This report describes recruitment strategies, an overview of survey measures, and basic descriptive statistics of the cohort.\n\n\nMethods\nThe cohort includes 468 mothers and their offspring. A brief survey was completed at a 1-wk home visit including child's birth weight, intent to breastfeed, collection of an infant stool sample, and additional contact information should the family move. Mothers completed surveys including diet, child temperament, family environment, and child care when their child was 6 wk, 3, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 mo of age. Height and weight of the mother and child were collected at each visit. Stool samples of the child were collected at each visit as well as saliva at 1 visit.\n\n\nResults\nClose to half of the mothers were either overweight (24.2%) or obese (25.2%) prepregnancy. At 6 wk of age, 32.9% of the children were overweight and 31.4% were obese based on direct measurement.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe STRONG Kids 2 research team has adopted a socioecological model that accounts for multiple influences on children's health including biological, child social and behavioral, family household organization, and community factors. The study is limited by a relatively educated and nondiverse sample. However, variations in maternal and child weight may inform future prevention programs and policy aimed at improving the diet and health of children under the age of 5 y.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03341858.",

For household food insecurity, the corresponding estimates are 11-69%. We also find that maternal depression increases reliance on several types of public programs, suggesting that the programs play a buffering role.",

        "abstract": "A large and rapidly growing share of US government expenditures pays for assistance to working-age people with disabilities. In 2008 federal spending for disability assistance totaled $357 billion, representing 12 percent of all federal outlays. The states' share of joint federal-state disability programs, more than 90 percent of it for Medicaid, was $71 billion. The increased cost of health care-which represented 55 percent of combined state and federal outlays for this population in 2008-is one of the two main causes of spending growth for people with disabilities. Health care is already likely to be a target of further efforts by states and the federal government to contain or reduce spending, and it is therefore probable that spending restraints will affect the working-age population with disabilities. In fact, unless ways can be identified to make delivery of health care to this population more efficient, policy makers may be unable to avoid funding cuts that will further compromise its well-being.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nWe examined the correlates and health implications of household food insecurity among Hispanic/Latino youth (aged 8-16 years), a high food insecurity-risk population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing the Hispanic Community Children's Health/Study of Latino Youth (n = 1,362) and bivariate and multivariate analyses, we examined the correlates of household and child food insecurity and very low food security. We assessed the influence of four sets of risk/protective factors-child demographic, acculturation, socioeconomic, and family/social support. We then examined associations between food insecurity and four health indicators-body mass index, diet quality, depression, and anxiety-and used modification effects to assess whether these associations differed by sex, age, household income, parent nativity, and acculturative stress levels.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found high rates of food insecurity: 42% of Hispanic/Latino youth experienced household food insecurity and 33% child food insecurity. Moreover, 10% lived in a very low food secure household. Compared with their food secure peers, Hispanic/Latino youth in food insecure households experienced greater parent/child acculturative and economic stress and weakened family support systems. Associations of food insecurity with health outcomes varied by sex, age, household income, parent nativity, and child acculturative stress levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFood insecurity is highly prevalent among Hispanic/Latino youth and has detrimental health implications, especially for girls, older youth, and youth experiencing acculturative stress. Reducing food insecurity and improving health among Hispanic/Latino youth will likely require comprehensive policies that address their multiple migration, familial, and economic stressors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Great Recession of 2007-2009 was the most severe and lengthy economic crisis in the U.S. since the Great Depression. The impacts on the population were multi-dimensional, but operated largely through local labor markets.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine differences in recession-related changes in county unemployment rates and assess how population and place characteristics shaped these patterns.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe calculate and decompose Theil Indexes to describe recession-related changes in the distribution of unemployment rates between counties and states. We use exploratory spatial statistics to identify geographic clusters of counties that experienced similar changes in unemployment. We use spatial regression to evaluate associations between county-level recession impacts on unemployment and demographic composition, industrial structure, and state context.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe recession was associated with increased inequality between county labor markets within states, but declining between-state differences. Counties that experienced disproportionate recession-related increases in unemployment were spatially clustered and characterized by large shares of historically disadvantaged racial and ethnic minority populations, low educational attainment, and heavy reliance on pro-cyclical industries. Associations between these sources of vulnerability were partially explained by unobserved state-level factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe local consequences of macroeconomic trends are associated with county population characteristics, as well as the structural contexts and policy environments in which they are embedded. The recession placed upward pressure on within-state inequality between local labor market conditions.\n\n\nCONTRIBUTION\nTo present new estimates of the recession's impact on local labor markets, quantify how heterogeneous impacts affected the distribution of unemployment prevalence, and identify county characteristics associated with disproportionately large recession-related increases in unemployment.",

        "abstract": "Medicaid reimbursements have become a key source of funding for nonprofit social service organizations operating outside the medical care sector, as well as an important tool for states seeking resources to fund social service programs within a devolving safety net. Drawing on unique survey data of more than one thousand nonprofit social service agencies in seven urban and rural communities, this article examines Medicaid funding of nonprofit social service organizations that target programs at working-age, nondisabled adults. We find that about one-quarter of nonprofit service organizations--mostly providers offering substance abuse and mental health treatment in conjunction with other services--report receiving Medicaid reimbursements, although very few are overly reliant on these funds. We also find Medicaid-funded social service nonprofits to be less accessible to residents of high-poverty neighborhoods or areas with concentrations of black or Hispanic residents than to residents of more affluent and white communities. We should expect that the role of Medicaid within the nonprofit social service sector will shift in the next few years, however, as states grapple with persistent budgetary pressures, rising Medicaid costs, and decisions to participate in the Medicaid expansion provisions contained within the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.",

Of the 69% of households that retained their child after investigation and were eligible for food stamps, 73% participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; of the 51% of kinship foster homes that were eligible, 58% participated; and of the 22% of traditional foster homes that were eligible, 26% participated. Participation rates for households involved in child welfare were lower than for households in the general population; traditional foster homes participated at the lowest rates. Outreach to child welfare–involved families and child welfare agencies are needed to increase enrollment.",

        "abstract": "Evidence suggests that household chaos is associated with less optimal child outcomes. Yet, there is an increasing indication that children's experiences in childcare may buffer them against the detrimental effects of such environments. Our study aims were to test: (1) whether children's experiences in childcare mitigated relations between household chaos and children's cognitive and social development, and (2) whether these (conditional) chaos effects were mediated by links between chaos and executive functioning. Using data from The Family Life Project (n = 1,235)-a population-based sample of families from low-income, rural contexts-our findings indicated that household disorganization in early childhood was predictive of worse cognitive and social outcomes at approximately age five. However, these relations were substantially attenuated for children attending greater childcare hours. Subsequent models indicated that the conditional associations between household disorganization and less optimal outcomes at age five were mediated by conditional links between disorganization and less optimal executive functioning.",

        "abstract": "Many aggregate-level studies suggest a relationship between economic inequality and socio-demographic outcomes such as family formation, health, and mortality; but individual-level evidence is lacking. Nor is there satisfactory evidence on the mechanisms by which inequality may have an effect. We study the determinants of transitions to a nonmarital first birth as a single parent or as a cohabiting parent compared to transitions to marriage prior to a first birth among unmarried, childless young adults in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort, from 1997 to 2011. We include measures of county-group-level household income inequality and of the availability of jobs typically held by high-school graduates and which pay above-poverty wages. We find that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to marriage prior to a first birth for both women and men. The association between levels of inequality and transitions to marriage can be partially accounted for by the availability of jobs of the type we measured. Some models also suggest that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to a first birth while cohabiting.",

        "abstract": "Child health and housing security are closely intertwined, and children without homes are more likely to suffer from chronic disease, hunger, and malnutrition than are children with homes. Homeless children and youth often have significant psychosocial development issues, and their education is frequently interrupted. Given the overall effects that homelessness can have on a child's health and potential, it is important for pediatricians to recognize the factors that lead to homelessness, understand the ways that homelessness and its causes can lead to poor health outcomes, and when possible, help children and families mitigate some of the effects of homelessness. Through practice change, partnership with community resources, awareness, and advocacy, pediatricians can help optimize the health and well-being of children affected by homelessness.",

        "abstract": "One in seven US households cannot reliably afford food. Food budgets are more frequently exhausted at the end of a month than at other points in time. We postulated that this monthly pattern influenced health outcomes, such as risk for hypoglycemia among people with diabetes. Using administrative data on inpatient admissions in California for 2000-08, we found that admissions for hypoglycemia were more common in the low-income than the high-income population (270 versus 200 admissions per 100,000). Risk for hypoglycemia admission increased 27 percent in the last week of the month compared to the first week in the low-income population, but we observed no similar temporal variation in the high-income population. These findings suggest that exhaustion of food budgets might be an important driver of health inequities. Policy solutions to improve stable access to nutrition in low-income populations and raise awareness of the health risks of food insecurity might be warranted.",

        "abstract": "The authors' purpose was to examine access to Family Independence Program and Food benefits in relation to customer service and an automated helpline. In addition, participants identified impediments and limitations to the receipt of services. Two hundred forty-four surveys were mailed to recipients of over-the-counter electronic benefit transfer cards; 58 were returned. The findings indicate that when customers (age 21-92) received assistance navigating the electronic benefits transfer system from local office staff, they were able to obtain benefits successfully. Negative credit/debit card history and touchtone phones were related to difficulty using the system. The results suggest that the local office and the contracted service provider (automatic helpline) need to provide assistance that promotes greater autonomy for the customer to make successful transitions to benefits that are delivered electronically.",

For the urban/suburban county, participants living with more people (after controlling for the total number of adults) were more likely to graduate. For the rural county, participants living with fewer total adults (after controlling for the total number in the house) and those with better food safety practices at baseline were more likely to graduate.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nThis study aids in understanding which participants are more or less likely to complete EFNEP successfully, and therefore can inform strategies aimed at increasing graduation rates.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nParents with serious mental illness may be vulnerable to financial insecurity, making successful parenting especially difficult. We explored relationships among parenting, serious mental illness, and economic status in a nationally representative sample.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe sample included all working-age participants from the 2009 and 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (n = 77,326). Two well-established scales of mental health distinguished participants with none, mild, moderate, and serious mental illness. We compared economic status by parenthood status and mental illness severity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRates of employment were low for parents with serious mental illness (38% full time and 17% part time among mothers; 60% full time and 9% part time among fathers) compared with parents with no mental illness (50% full time and 19% part time among mothers; 85% full time and 5% part time among fathers). Mothers and fathers with serious mental illness were twice as likely to fall below the U.S. Census poverty threshold as their peers without mental illness.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nParents with serious mental illness are less likely to be employed than those without mental illnesses, and are highly likely to be living in poverty. Reducing poverty by helping parents with serious mental illness achieve better jobs and education is likely to translate into family stability and better outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Research has documented modest positive impacts of early childhood home visiting programs. However, understanding more about what home visitors do during visits and how much time they spend on specific topics may provide insight into the variability in effectiveness of services. Methods Outcome data were collected via parent survey at program enrollment and 12 months from 123 women in three MIECHV-funded home visiting models. Home visitors completed weekly home visit content and activity logs. Results Families received an average of 28 visits during the study (3.1 visits per month). Of ten content areas, the three most often discussed were early childhood development, physical care of children, and the parent–child-relationship. Multivariate regression models were used to explore the association of home visit dosage, home visit content and cumulative risk factors on parenting outcomes. Women whose visits were focused more on parenting topics reported lower parenting-related stress at follow-up compared to those whose visits had less parenting content. Additionally, higher-risk women who received greater numbers of home visits showed larger reductions in their attitudes about harsh punishment over time, compared to high-risk women with fewer home visits. Discussion Receiving home visits that emphasize parenting content may contribute to reduced parenting-related stress. For high-risk women in particular, receiving more visits overall may be important to achieving positive outcomes. Implications for practice include working to engage and retain high-risk families. Future home visiting research calls for improved methods for collecting data on content/activity during visits, the necessity for long-term follow-up, and testing for the effectiveness of varied and flexible visit schedules/content focus for women and families with trauma exposure.",

Results showed Food Stamps utilization to be associated positively with TANF receipt; in-kind assistance; child-support receipt; number of dependent children; and being African American, female, and disabled and associated negatively with financial support from relatives/friends, family earnings, metropolitan areas, education and occupational skill, age, and being married.

The SBP is a federal entitlement program that offers breakfast to any student, including free breakfast for any low-income student, who attends a school that participates in the program. To increase the availability of the SBP, many states mandate that schools participate in the program if the percent of free or reduced-price eligible students in a school exceeds a specific threshold. Using the details of these mandates as a source of identifying variation, I find that the availability of the program increases student achievement.",

        "abstract": "We present a 50‐year historical perspective of the nation's antipoverty efforts, describing the evolution of policy during four key periods since 1965. Over this half‐century, the initial heavy reliance on cash income support to poor families has eroded; increases in public support came largely in the form of in‐kind (e.g., Food Stamps) and tax‐related (e.g., the Earned Income Tax Credit) benefits. Work support and the supplementation of earnings substituted for direct support. These shifts eroded the safety net for the most disadvantaged in American society. Three poverty‐related analytical developments are also described. The rise of the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM)—taking account of noncash and tax‐related benefits—has corrected some of the serious weaknesses of the official poverty measure (OPM). The SPM measure indicates that the poverty rate has declined over time, rather than being essentially flat as the OPM implies. We also present snapshots of the composition of the poor population in the United States using both the OPM and the SPM, showing progress in reducing poverty overall and among specific socioeconomic subgroups since the beginning of the War on Poverty. Finally, we document the expenditure levels of numerous antipoverty programs that have accompanied the several phases of poverty policy and describe the effect of these efforts on the level of poverty. Although the effectiveness of government antipoverty transfers is debated, our findings indicate that the growth of antipoverty policies has reduced the overall level of poverty, with substantial reductions among the elderly, disabled, and blacks. However, the poverty rates for children, especially those living in single‐parent families, and families headed by a low‐skill, low‐education person, have increased. Rates of deep poverty (families living with less than one‐half of the poverty line) for the nonelderly population have not decreased, reflecting both the increasing labor market difficulties faced by the low‐skill population and the tilt of means‐tested benefits away from the poorest of the poor.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this clinical concept report is to describe a public health project in rural Indiana that addressed the complex social issue or \"wicked problem\" of childhood trauma. The project was implemented through a unique partnership between nursing faculty and Cooperative Extension Educators, community-based workers who are associated with fulfilling the mission of Land Grant Universities. The core focus of the project entailed a nurse and a Cooperative Extension Educator co-teaching trauma-informed parenting classes to rural dwelling, kinship caregivers. Kinship caregivers are often grandparents who assume the parenting role after the child has been removed from the birth parents' care. The trauma-informed curriculum was developed by experts in child trauma and is available through the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. The unique partnership provided insight into the different missions of the two organizations, different values and workflow metrics, and different schedules, which at times proved to be barriers to implementation. This discussion focuses on deconstructing the goals and objectives of the project and retrospectively, describing recommendations so that public health nurses may partner with Extension Educators in their communities for optimal project success.",

        "abstract": "Obesity poses substantial costs both to the individual and society, mainly through its impact on health and labor productivity. Because obesity is more prevalent among the poor some have raised concerns that food assistance programs may encourage excess weight. This paper investigates whether the U.S. Food Stamp Program contributes to adult participants' weight as measured by body mass index (BMI). Results suggest that the typical female food stamp participant's BMI is indeed more than 1 unit higher than someone with the same socioeconomic characteristics who is not in the program. For the average American woman, who is 5 ft 4 in. (1.63 m) tall, this means an increase in weight of 5.8 pounds (2.6 kg). While this association does not prove that the Food Stamp Program causes weight gain, it does suggest that program changes to encourage the consumption of high-nutrient, low-calorie foods should be considered.",

        "abstract": "Sixteen years ago, the 105th Congress, responding to the needs of 10 million children in the United States who lacked health insurance, created the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Enacted as Title XXI of the Social Security Act, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP; or SCHIP as it has been known at some points) provided states with federal assistance to create programs specifically designed for children from families with incomes that exceeded Medicaid thresholds but that were insufficient to enable them to afford private health insurance. Congress provided $40 billion in block grants over 10 years for states to expand their existing Medicaid programs to cover the intended populations, to erect new stand-alone SCHIP programs for these children, or to effect some combination of both options. Congress reauthorized CHIP once in 2009 under the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act and extended its life further within provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The purpose of this statement is to review the features of CHIP as it has evolved over the 16 years of its existence; to summarize what is known about the effects that the program has had on coverage, access, health status, and disparities among participants; to identify challenges that remain with respect to insuring this group of vulnerable children, including the impact that provisions of the new Affordable Care Act will have on the issue of health insurance coverage for near-poor children after 2015; and to offer recommendations on how to expand and strengthen the national commitment to provide health insurance to all children regardless of means.",

        "abstract": "Jeffrey Passel surveys demographic trends and projections in the U.S. youth population, with an emphasis on trends among immigrant youth. He traces shifts in the youth population over the past hundred years, examines population projections through 2050, and offers some observations about the likely impact of the immigrant youth population on American society.Passel provides data on the legal status of immigrant youth and their families and on their geographic distribution and concentration across the United States. He emphasizes two demographic shifts. First, immigrant youth—defined as those children under age eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents—now account for one-fourth of the nation's 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. Second, the wave of immigration under way since the mid-1960s has made children the most racially and ethnically diverse age group in the United States. In 1960 Hispanic, Asian, and mixed-race youth made up about 6 percent of all U.S. children; today that share is almost 30 percent. During that same period the share of non-Hispanic white children steadily dropped from about 81 percent to 56 percent, while the share of black children climbed very slightly to 14 percent. By 2050 the share of non-Hispanic white children is projected to drop to 40 percent, while that of Hispanic children will increase to about one-third. This changing demographic structure in U.S. youth is likely to present policy makers with several challenges in coming decades, including higher rates of poverty among youth, particularly among foreign-born children and children of undocumented parents; high concentrations of immigrants in a handful of states; and a lack of political voice. A related challenge may be intergenerational competition between youth and the elderly for governmental support such as education funding, Social Security, and government health benefits. In conclusion, Passel notes that today's immigrants and their children will shape many aspects of American society and will provide virtually all the growth in the U.S. labor force over the next forty years. Their integration into American society and their accumulation of human capital thus require continued attention from researchers and policy makers.",

As a result, qualitative methods were used to understand service providers’ views about programs and services they use when assisting grandparents raising grandchildren. We conducted telephone interviews with professional service providers (N = 16) from agencies serving grandparents. Data were transcribed verbatim and transcripts were analyzed using an inductive, constant comparison approach. Findings revealed two themes reflecting the types of services and support mechanisms providers’ use with grandparent caregivers and providers’ needs and recommendations to better serve grandparent caregivers. Participants fully supported continual funding for the Kinship Care System Navigator position and discussed the importance of community providers sharing a common voice and working together. It is important that professionals who serve grandparent caregivers are knowledgeable and willing to collaborate with other providers to meet grandparents’ needs.",

        "abstract": "The combination of fee-for-service payments and the US health care system's standing commitment to treating existing illness discourages spending on the behavioral, social, and environmental (that is, the nonmedical) conditions that contribute most to long-term health. Pay-for-success, alternatively known as social impact bonds, or SIBs, offers a possible solution. The pay-for-success model relies on an investor that is willing to fund a nonmedical intervention up front while bearing the risk that the intervention may fail to prevent disease in the future. Should the intervention succeed, however, the investor is repaid in full by a predetermined payer (such as a public health agency) and receives an additional return on its investment as a reward for taking on the risk. Pay-for-success pilots are being developed to reduce asthma-related emergencies among children, poor birth outcomes, and the progression of prediabetes to diabetes, among other applications. These efforts, supported by key policy reforms such as public agency data sharing and coordinated care, promise to increase the number of evidence-based nonmedical service providers and seed a new market that values health, not just health care.",

        "abstract": "Poverty during childhood raises a number of policy challenges. The earliest years are critical in terms of future cognitive and emotional development and early health outcomes, and have long-lasting consequences on future health. In this article child poverty in the United States is compared with a set of other developed countries. To the surprise of few, results show that child poverty is high in the United States. But why is poverty so much higher in the United States than in other rich nations? Among child poverty drivers, household composition and parent's labor market participation matter a great deal. But these are not insurmountable problems. Many of these disadvantages can be overcome by appropriate public policies. For example, single mothers have a very high probability of poverty in the United States, but this is not the case in other countries where the provision of work support increases mothers' labor earnings and together with strong public cash support effectively reduces child poverty. In this article we focus on the role and design of public expenditure to understand the functioning of the different national systems and highlight ways for improvements to reduce child poverty in the United States. We compare relative child poverty in the United States with poverty in a set of selected countries. The takeaway is that the United States underinvests in its children and their families and in so doing this leads to high child poverty and poor health and educational outcomes. If a nation like the United States wants to decrease poverty and improve health and life chances for poor children, it must support parental employment and incomes, and invest in children's futures as do other similar nations with less child poverty.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundComprehensive, multi-level approaches are required to address obesity. One important target for intervention is the economic domain. The purpose of this study was to synthesize existing evidence regarding the impact of economic policies targeting obesity and its causal behaviours (diet, physical activity), and to make specific recommendations for the Canadian context.MethodsArksey and O'Malley's (2005) methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews was adopted for this study and this consisted of two phases: 1) a structured literature search and review, and 2) consultation with experts in the research field through a Delphi survey and an in-person expert panel meeting in April 2010.ResultsTwo key findings from the scoping review included 1) consistent evidence that weight outcomes are responsive to food and beverage prices. The debate on the use of food taxes and subsidies to address obesity should now shift to how best to address practical issues in designing such policies; and 2) very few studies have examined the impact of economic instruments to promote physical activity and clear policy recommendations cannot be made at this time. Delphi survey findings emphasised the relatively modest impact any specific economic instrument would have on obesity independently. Based on empirical evidence and expert opinion, three recommendations were supported. First, to create and implement an effective health filter to review new and current agricultural polices to reduce the possibility that such policies have a deleterious impact on population rates of obesity. Second, to implement a caloric sweetened beverage tax. Third, to examine how to implement fruit and vegetable subsidies targeted at children and low income households.ConclusionsIn terms of economic interventions, shifting from empirical evidence to policy recommendation remains challenging. Overall, the evidence is not sufficiently strong to provide clear policy direction. Additionally, the nature of the experiments needed to provide definitive evidence supporting certain policy directions is likely to be complex and potentially unfeasible. However, these are not reasons to take no action. It is likely that policies need to be implemented in the face of an incomplete evidence base.",

This randomized controlled trial assessed how well FS services aligned with family interests and needs, how FS providers used communication strategies to build partnership with mothers, and the impact of FS on mothers’ parenting knowledge in core content areas and access to services. Mothers completed a baseline survey and were randomly assigned to FS and control conditions (n = 374 and 375, respectively). The parenting education services provided to mothers were assessed by independent participant report immediately postintervention for the full FS group and by analysis of audio-recordings of the FS encounter for a subsample (n = 150). Outcomes were measured at 4 months via maternal survey. Compared to controls at follow-up, FS mothers had significantly higher knowledge scores in some areas but similar access to needed services. Few mothers lacked access to most services at baseline, and FS content was similar to that provided by other hospital personnel. FS providers’ communication style promoted rapport, but providers did not tailor content to mothers’ educational and service access needs. Implications of the findings for similar services are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The mission of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans. In my work as deputy assistant secretary for human services at HHS, I have noticed that people think that HHS focuses solely on fostering advances in medicine and public health and ensuring access to effective clinical services through Medicare and Medicaid. Far fewer people know about our work in human services and how it relates to the health of Americans. In this Executive Perspective, I explain why the second part of the department’s name, human services, is equally vital to health services in achieving the goal of a healthier US population. I will tie this to Public Health 3.0, the new vision of public health introduced by Acting Assistant Secretary for Health Karen DeSalvo, as the framework. Our nation’s health and well-being have long ranked poorly when compared with other developed nations. Within the United States health outcomes vary greatly across communities, counties, and states and among populations, with racial/ethnic minority groups, low income, and low education levels consistently associated with poor health. The lower health status in these populations likely reflects insufficient progress in addressing the fundamental social and economic conditions of our society and the healthrelated behaviors (eg, tobacco use, consumption of excess calories) that accompany these conditions. Healthy People 2020 enumerates the social determinants of health as economic stability, education, social and community context, and neighborhood and built environment. Healthy People 2020 also lists access to health care services as a social determinant of health, but the public health community has long known that health care services predict a relatively small proportion of health outcomes. For example, the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps program supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that among social determinants, health care services account for only about 15% of variance in health outcomes, whereas health behaviors and the socioeconomic conditions that influence them account for at least 60% of variance. Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention positions socioeconomic conditions at the base of its health impact pyramid, indicating that these factors have the biggest health impact, followed by changing the context (neighborhood and built environment, policies influencing behaviors) and—with more limited reach and greater cost—direct health care services. Human services have a dual purpose. They strive to protect vulnerable populations from harms such as food insecurity, housing instability, abuse, and neglect. In addition, they seek to help people provide for themselves, thrive, and contribute to society. By engaging in this work, human services directly affect the social determinants of health. Although not designed to influence health per se (except when using the World Health Organization broad framing of health; ie, the complete state of well-being), human services can profoundly affect traditional health outcomes. Indeed, they may have as great an impact or an even greater impact on traditional health indicators (eg, life expectancy) as medical services alone once basic health care services are in place. Examples from one of our HHS agencies, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), demonstrate this concept in practice. Many of HHS’s human services programs are based at ACF, particularly those affecting children, adolescents, young adults, and families (human services programs affecting older Americans and those with disabilities reside within the Administration for Community Living). I will briefly describe the focus of several of these programs and highlight how their efforts directly and indirectly affect the social determinants of health among their constituents. One of ACF’s largest programs, Head Start, which includes the Early Head Start program, provides early childhood care and education. Head Start is a signature human services program. It provides high-quality early care and education services, along with access to healthy foods,",

In the past ten years, the number of studies assessing new ways to conceptualize and understand how acculturation-related processes may influence health has grown. These new frameworks draw from integrative approaches testing new ground to acknowledge the fundamental role of context and policy. We classify the emerging body of evidence according to themes that we identify as promising directions--intrapersonal, interpersonal, social environmental, community, political, and global contexts, cross-cutting themes in life course and developmental approaches, and segmented assimilation--and discuss the challenges and opportunities each theme presents. This body of work, which considers acculturation in context, points to the emergence of a new wave of research that holds great promise in driving forward the study of Latino immigrants, acculturation, and health. We provide suggestions to further advance the ideologic and methodologic rigor of this new wave.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: We evaluated an intervention combining policy training and technical assistance for childcare teachers with a nutrition education curriculum to improve (1) the knowledge and self-efficacy of childcare teachers in implementing obesity prevention policies and practices, (2) the quantity and quality of nutrition and physical activity education, and (3) the childcare wellness environment. Methods: Thirteen teachers and 8 administrators (2 of whom were also teachers) from 8 childcare programs in Clarke County, Georgia, participated in the Healthy Child Care Georgia intervention during June-October 2015. The intervention included (1) training and technical assistance on obesity prevention policies, systems, and practices and (2) direct education by teachers using the Eat Healthy, Be Active curriculum. We assessed changes in program wellness policy adoption and teacher knowledge and self-efficacy from pre- to post-intervention through self-report questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups. Results: Teachers’ knowledge scores (maximum score = 100) rose significantly from a mean (SD) pre-intervention of 67.1 (14.6) to post-intervention of 83.2 (14.3) (P < .001). The mean score for “teaching nutrition and activity to children” (maximum score = 105) rose significantly from 86.9 (8.2) to 93.5 (5.2) (P = .011) and for “modeling and supporting children” (maximum score = 63) from 55.8 (5.1) to 59.5 (4.5) (P = .015). The mean (SD) scores for breastfeeding and infant feeding policy/practice adoption (maximum score = 6) increased significantly from 2.5 (1.8) to 3.7 (1.9) (P = .043) and for nutrition education policy/practice adoption (maximum score = 4) from 2.0 (1.3) to 3.3 (1.4) (P = .019). The combined approach enhanced classroom nutrition education and improved the adoption of best practices. Conclusion: Future studies should examine the effects of using a combined approach to promote nutrition and physical activity policies and practices in the early care and education setting.",

        "abstract": "Between 2000 and 2005, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, until recently, the Food Stamp Program) caseload increased by half. As the Great Recession unfolded, the SNAP caseload grew even more rapidly. Further, over the past two decades the composition of the caseload has shifted sharply away from families combining food and cash assistance and toward families receiving food assistance in the absence of any other major, means-tested income support. By analyzing components of the caseload separately, we provide new and more insightful estimates of the effects of food and cash assistance policies and the economy on both the change in the composition of the caseload and the large caseload swings over the 1990s and 2000s. We find that the economy can explain a portion of caseload changes, but not compositional shifts. Food and cash assistance policies help to explain both changes. In total, the combination of SNAP and welfare policy changes account for about half of the sharp increase since 1994 in the share of SNAP households receiving food, but not cash, assistance. © 2011 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.",

        "abstract": "Disability benefits have become an increasingly prominent source of cash assistance for impoverished American citizens over the past two decades. This development coincided with cuts and market-oriented reforms to state and federal welfare programs, characteristic of the wider political-economic trends collectively referred to as neoliberalism. Recent research has argued that contemporary discourses on 'disability fraudsters' and 'malingerers' associated with this shift represent the latest manifestation of age-old stigmatization of the 'undeserving poor'. Few studies, however, have investigated how the system of disability benefits, as well as these stigmatizing discourses, shapes the lived experience of disabling physical illness in today's United States. Here we present qualitative data from 64 semi-structured interviews with low-income individuals living with HIV and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus to explore the experience of long-term, work-limiting disability in the San Francisco Bay Area. Interviews were conducted between April and December 2014. Participants explained how they had encountered what they perceived to be excessive, obstructive, and penalizing bureaucracy from social institutions, leading to destitution and poor mental health. They also described being stigmatized as disabled for living with chronic ill health, and simultaneously stigmatized as shirking and malingering for claiming disability benefits as a result. Notably, this latter form of stigma appeared to be exacerbated by the bureaucracy of the administrating institutions. Participants also described intersections of health-related stigma with stigmas of poverty, gender, sexual orientation, and race. The data reveal a complex picture of poverty and intersectional stigma in this population, potentiated by a convoluted and inflexible bureaucracy governing the system of disability benefits. We discuss how these findings reflect the historical context of neoliberal cuts and reforms to social institutions, and add to ongoing debate around the future of public social provision for impoverished and chronically ill citizens under neoliberalism.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nA 22-week federally qualified health center (FQHC)-based farmers' market (FM) and personal financial incentive intervention designed to improve access to and consumption of fruits and vegetables (FVs) among low-income diabetics in rural South Carolina was evaluated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA mixed methods, one-group, repeated-measures design was used. Data were collected in 2011 before (May/June), during (August), and after (November) the intervention with 41 diabetes patients from the FQHC. FV consumption was assessed using a validated National Cancer Institute FV screener modified to include FV sold at the FM. Sales receipts were recorded for all FM transactions. A mixed-model, repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess intervention effects on FV consumption. Predictors of changes in FV consumption were examined using logistic regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA marginally significant (p=0.07) average increase of 1.6 servings of total FV consumption per day occurred. The odds of achieving significant improvements in FV consumption increased for diabetics using financial incentives for payment at the FM (OR: 38.8, 95% CI: 3.4-449.6) and for those frequenting the FM more often (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.0).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults reveal a dose-response relationship between the intervention and FV improvements and emphasize the importance of addressing economic barriers to food access.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the association between poverty and food insecurity among children, using two different definitions of poverty-the official poverty measure (OPM) and the new supplemental poverty measure (SPM) of the Census Bureau, which is based on a more inclusive definition of family resources and needs. Our analysis is based on data from the 2001-11 Current Population Survey and shows that food insecurity and very low food security among children decline as income-to-needs ratio increases. The point estimates show that the associations are stronger as measured by the new supplemental measure of income-to-needs ratio than when estimated through the official measure. Statistical tests reject the hypothesis that poor households' odds of experiencing low food security are the same whether the SPM or OPM measure is used; but the tests do not reject the hypothesis when very low food security is the outcome.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTHunger mitigation in the United States has traditionally blended a variety of “emergency resources,” from both the public and private sectors, yet the long-term use of these programs, food pantries in particular, is becoming commonplace. Still, there is little information on long-term (24+ months) pantry use. This article examines the differences, particularly in food security status and use of federal support programs, between traditional, short-term emergency pantry users and an emerging population of long-term users. We found that there are 2 distinct groups of long-term users based on frequency of use, prolonged (infrequent) and persistent (frequent), and that each of these groups has distinct vulnerability to food insecurity as well as mitigation strategies for dealing with food insecurity.",

        "abstract": "Welfare eligibility is usually determined via income and financial assets. Since devolution of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families administration in 1996, there is significant state variation in these criteria. Previous research suggests that income limits are influenced by racial politics, with more restrictive criteria associated with higher Black populations. The current study examined whether asset testing is similarly determined. Findings indicate that asset tests are positively associated with a democratic State Senate, median income, and the percentage of Black residents. The presence of advocates seeking to advance asset-building opportunities to low-income families may have influenced this divergence in income and asset testing.",

        "abstract": "Subpopulations have variable connections to specific institutions, such as the military, which can influence their use of social programs and access to resources. We use data from the 5-year (2008–2012) American Community Survey (ACS) public-use file to examine current Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) use by military service status: active-duty personnel, recent veterans, long-term veterans, and reserve/guard members. Overall and by military service status, we estimate weighted descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression models that include demographic and socioeconomic controls. We document low but non-trivial levels of participation among active-duty personnel (2.2 %), higher but still moderate levels of SNAP use among veterans (7.1 % for recent veterans and 6.5 % for long-term veterans), and the highest level of use among members of the reserve/guard (9.0 %). Multivariate analyses support hypotheses based on the potential for the military, as a total institution, to substantially reduce use of SNAP among active-duty personnel, while veterans and reservists, who are more distal from food-related institutional resources, have higher likelihoods of using SNAP. Although levels of SNAP use among active-duty personnel, veterans, and reservists are lower than those observed in the national population, which includes those with no direct connection to military institutions, findings suggest that leaving active-duty military service results in a substantial and relatively immediate reduction in food-related resources for many recent veterans and their families. We discuss the implications of the findings for policy, limitations of the research, and directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Whether place-based welfare programs affect fertility and health outcomes is an understudied question. I estimate the health impacts of the Empowerment Zone (EZ) program-a federal program that gave sizeable grants and tax breaks to certain high-poverty census tracts in selected cities. Using difference-in-differences methods, I find that the EZ program decreased fertility rates by 11 percent and improved birth outcomes. Compositional changes in fertility likely cannot explain changes in infant health. Recent research on the later-life impacts of low birth weight suggest that the health impacts of this program may have substantial long-term benefits.",

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services eliminated 41% of funding for 2017 navigator programs and 90% of funding for outreach, arguing less investment was needed. Given that many remain uninsured, it is critical to identify effective enrollment practices. This study characterizes barriers and enrollment strategies from the perspective of California's Medicaid government and community-based enrollment workers (n=101 in eight focus groups). Participants identified a need for communication with policymakers, the state exchange, and each other regarding changing enrollment processes. Solutions include increased contact between enrollment workers to share strategies and policy updates regarding application processing, uniform policy interpretation, and details of ACA-related immigration law. Given efforts to weaken the ACA, it is critical to engage frontline workers in problem solving to streamline enrollment strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe Great Recession that officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 was the most severe recession since the Depression of the 1930s. To accurately explain the number of families and children receiving cash assistance from Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) during the 2007 recession, it is important to capture state-level variations in recessionary periods, economies, and TANF policies. This study breaks ground by using multiple regression to explain the number of families enrolled in the TANF program when the TANF caseload peaked in each of the 51 jurisdictions’ recessions as a function of their severe TANF policies while controlling for benefit levels, unemployment rates, and size of populations. Key findings strongly suggest that all else constant, TANF did not grow as much as it would have in the 2007 recession partially due to shorter lifetime limits (less than 60 months) or temporary time limits, multiple severe policies, or benefit cuts witnessed in some states.

        "abstract": "Social policy scholars disagree about which factors best predict U.S. welfare state generosity. We argue that this disagreement is an artifact of study designs. Researchers usually study either the totality of a state’s social expenditures or one specific program. These approaches overlook the fact that individual social programs were born of different circumstances and serve different constituencies. Comparing state-level policies for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), our findings suggest that these programs are governed by distinct logics of redistribution. Racial characteristics drive TANF generosity. Economic forces best predict CHIP generosity. SNAP generosity is a function of political factors. Qualitative data from Congressional hearings confirm these findings. These results adjudicate between conflicting accounts of the contemporary welfare state and also highlight which aspects ...",

        "abstract": "Low-income children’s access to meals decreases during the summer months due to losing the benefit of the free and reduced-price lunches they normally receive during the school year. Few studies critically examine community-based approaches to providing summer meals. This mixed methods study examined a mobile meal program implemented in a community with large economic disparities. Parents and caregivers who attended the mobile meal program with a child at one of three sites completed surveys that screened for risk of food insecurity and examined access and utilization of community food resources. Interviews with a representative subsample of English- and Spanish-speaking participants elicited an in-depth understanding of food insecurity in the community and perspectives on the mobile meal program. Surveys (n = 284) were completed in English (78%) and Spanish (22%). Participants identified primarily as Asian (32%), Latino/Hispanic (29%), and White (27%), with 26% screening positive for risk of food insecurity within the past 12 months. Qualitative interviews (n = 36) revealed widespread support for meals served in public settings as they were perceived to be welcoming, fostered social interactions, and helped the community at large. Participants described the high cost of living as a key motivation for participating and cited immigration fears as a barrier to accessing public resources. Findings from this study suggest the importance of innovative community-based approaches to serving hard-to-reach children during the summer.",

We use longitudinal survey data from the Health and Retirement Study linked to administrative Medicare records and biomarker data to assess the relationship between Food Stamp receipt and diabetes health outcomes. We find no significant difference in Medicare spending, outpatient utilization, diabetes hospitalizations and blood sugar (HbA1c) levels between recipients and income-eligible non-recipients after controlling for a detailed set of covariates including individual fixed effects and measures of diabetes treatment compliance. As one-third of elderly Food Stamp recipients are currently diabetic, greater coordination between the Food Stamp, Medicare, and Medicaid programs may improve health outcomes for this group.",

This article describes findings from both peer-reviewed and grey literature pertaining to factors that influence SNAP participation. SNAP participation has demonstrated benefits for low-income individuals and families for improving dietary intake, reducing food insecurity, and ultimately providing one strategy to alleviate poverty. The findings are described with a social science and behavioral lens in order to glean public health implications and recommendations from a broad array of literature. Factors influencing SNAP participation across the social–ecological model are discussed. Macro- and microlevel recommendations are made and actions applicable in targeted outreach, program, and organizational strategies are recommended.",

        "abstract": "AbstractLoss of market income to families is recognized as a major risk factor of child neglect. In the 2008 recession, some poor families replaced their market incomes with cash assistance from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Using secondary data for 42 contiguous jurisdictions and DC, we examined the relationship between increases in TANF caseloads and changes in substantiated child neglect cases in each of the contiguous jurisdiction’s 2008 recession. Key findings suggest that reductions in child neglect cases in the presence of increasing TANF caseloads were more profound in about half the states than any increases in child neglect cases found in the remainder of the states. Applying Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis tools, local spatial clusters were found in four neighboring states in the Midwest-South corridor suggesting that child neglect increases were similar and substantial across these four states. Our findings provide important information to stakeholders who may want to bette...",

        "abstract": "This study examined, among children, the associations among chaos in the home, diurnal cortisol patterns, eating behaviors and being overweight. Participants included 331 low-income children aged 3-4years. Mean salivary cortisol-intercept (representing morning peak, 60min since waking) and cortisol-slope (representing diurnal decline after peak) were calculated using mixed models from samples obtained across 3days. Parents reported chaos in the home by questionnaire and responded to the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire, generating subscales Food Responsiveness (FR), Emotional Overeating (EO), Enjoyment of Food (EF), and Satiety Responsiveness (SR). Body mass index was categorized as overweight vs. not. Path analysis evaluated associations among chaos, cortisol patterns, eating behaviors, and weight status. Children living in more chaotic homes had lower morning cortisol levels, consistent with \"hypocortisolism\" reported among individuals who have experienced significant allostatic load as a result of substantial early life chronic stress. Among girls, the hypocortisolism pattern predicted a higher likelihood of being overweight both directly and mediated through reduced Satiety Responsiveness; in boys, the association of the hypocortisolism pattern with being overweight was mediated entirely through Emotional Overeating. In summary, our results provide support for the conceptual model that psychosocial stress contributes to hypocortisolism, which contributes directly to a higher likelihood of being overweight in girls, and indirectly through reduced Satiety Responsiveness in girls and through increased Emotional Overeating in boys.",

        "abstract": "Public policies play a crucial role in shaping how immigrants adapt to life in the United States. Federal, state, and local laws and administrative practices impact immigrants' access to education, health insurance and medical care, cash assistance, food assistance, and other vital services. Additionally, immigration enforcement activities have substantial effects on immigrants' health and participation in public programs, as well as effects on immigrants' families. This review summarizes the growing literature on the consequences of public policies for immigrants' health. Some policies are inclusive and promote immigrants' adaptation to the United States, whereas other policies are exclusionary and restrict immigrants' access to public programs as well as educational and economic opportunities. We explore the strategies that researchers have employed to tease out these effects, the methodological challenges of undertaking such studies, their varying impacts on immigrant health, and steps that can be undertaken to improve the health of immigrants and their families.",

        "abstract": "Public health interventions to increase supermarket access assume that shopping in supermarkets is associated with healthier food purchases compared to other store types. To test this assumption, we compared purchasing patterns by store-type for certain higher-calorie, less healthy foods (HCF) and lower-calorie, healthier foods (LCF) in a sample of 35 black women household shoppers in Philadelphia, PA. Data analyzed were from 450 food shopping receipts collected by these shoppers over four-week periods in 2012. We compared the likelihood of purchasing the HCF (sugar-sweetened beverages, sweet/salty snacks, and grain-based snacks) and LCF (low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables) at full-service supermarkets and six other types of food retailers, using generalized estimating equations. Thirty-seven percent of participants had household incomes at or below the poverty line, and 54% had a BMI >30. Participants shopped primarily at full-service supermarkets (55%) or discount/limited assortment supermarkets (22%), making an average of 11 shopping trips over a 4-week period and spending mean (SD) of $350 ($222). Of full-service supermarket receipts, 64% included at least one HCF item and 58% at least one LCF. Most trips including HCF (58%) and LCF (60%) expenditures were to full-service or discount/limited assortment supermarkets rather than smaller stores. Spending a greater percent of total dollars in full-service supermarkets was associated with spending more on HCF (p = 0.03) but not LCF items (p = 0.26). These findings in black women suggest a need for more attention to supermarket interventions that change retailing practices and/or consumer shopping behaviors related to foods in the HCF categories examined.",

        "abstract": "The declining availability of cash welfare, and an income support system that increasingly provides benefits that complement, rather than replace, paid work, combine to raise concerns about families disconnected from work and welfare. These concerns were further heightened in the recent recession. While past research on disconnected populations has been particularly useful in understanding disconnection in relation to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), new patterns of program participation suggest the importance of considering broader populations. Further, while past research has noted that many of the “disconnected” receive some form of public assistance other than TANF, less is known about the importance of these other sources of support. Finally, while there is some evidence of increases in disconnection over time, most analyses focus on a single cohort. This study, of TANF and SNAP participating families in Wisconsin, adds to the literature on disconnection by analyzing how patterns of disconnection vary for different program participation populations; across cohorts; and by different definitions of “disconnection.”",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTUsing the 2013 Current Population Survey, this article examines predictors of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation using an adapted version of Andersen’s behavioral model of service use. All variables were found to be significant. We created a risk index, an index counting the number of predictive characteristics an individual possessed, to calculate predicted probabilities of SNAP participation. For each additional risk factor an individual possessed, the predicted probability increased on average by 0.09. Those possessing 10 or more risk factors had the highest predicted probability (74%) of SNAP participation. This research confirms known predictors of SNAP participation. The risk index demonstrates that it is possible to predict SNAP participation not by which factors an individual possesses but how many.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nApproximately 10%-20% of women suffer from postpartum depression (PPD), important predictors of which are antenatal stressful life event (SLE) experiences. The association between women's state-level socioeconomic status (SES) and PPD has not been explored. This study aimed to examine whether the association between antenatal SLE and PPD symptoms was moderated by women's state-level SES.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from the 2009-2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) were used. State-level women's employment/earnings and social/economic autonomy indices were computed from indicators published by the Institute of Women's Policy Research (IWPR). Multilevel multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 91,253 women with valid responses, 11.3% had PPD symptoms, prevalence ranging from 7.1% in Illinois to 17.1% in Arkansas. Women who experienced all four stressor categories, including partner related, traumatic, emotional, and financial, had the highest odds (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.36-5.51) of PPD symptoms. The odds of experiencing PPD symptoms decreased with an increase in the state-level social/economic autonomy index (aOR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.64-0.88). There was significant cross-level interaction between number of stressor categories experienced and state-level index.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nScreening for antenatal SLEs can help identify women at risk for PPD symptoms. That the odds of having PPD symptoms decreased with increasing state-level social/economic autonomy and women residing in states with lower indices were more vulnerable to the impacts of antenatal stressors, could have policy implications related to improving the SES of women in these states.",

All patients received financial assistance from an abortion fund to help pay for abortion. Case data were analyzed to assess types and numbers of hardships experienced by age, race, and geographic origin. Hardships ranged from homelessness to parenting multiple children. Patients from the geographic South experienced the most hardships, followed by those from the Midwest. Hardships experienced by abortion fund patients are like those reported in other samples of abortion patients; hardships potentially cause or exacerbate trauma. Results are discussed in the context of a trauma-informed perspective.",

        "abstract": "Household food insecurity (HFI) has been linked to poorer cardiometabolic health and reduced health care access but few studies have examined these issues in the large Mexican immigrant population living on the U.S.-Mexico border. This exploratory study examined the association of HFI with cardiometabolic conditions and health care in 40–84 year urban border immigrants (n = 75). Data were collected on HFI, self-reported and clinical cardiometabolic conditions, health care sources and use. HFI affected 45% of participants. HFI was associated with self-reported and clinical diabetes but not hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, or metabolic syndrome. It also was associated with increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations but not source of primary health care or preventative health care use. These findings highlight the need for additional research on the relationship of HFI with cardiometabolic health and health care in border immigrants as well as reassessment of current immigrant food security and health laws and policies.",

Although the recession led to increased need and SNAP participation in both states, state differences in prerecession program policies and efforts to enroll and retain eligible participants provide a plausible explanation for lower exit rates and longer spell durations in Oregon. Implications of these findings for low income households, policymakers and future research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The year 2016 marked the twentieth anniversary of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC) with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Whereas AFDC was based on an open-ended matching grant, TANF is funded with a block grant from the federal government and “maintenance of effort” (MOE) obligations for states, which were generally set at 75 percent of nominal expenditures in the mid-1990s. This article looks at trends in TANF funding compared to trends in child poverty. We include a more comprehensive poverty measure and adjustments for interstate variation in prices. Over the past decade, inequality in state resources per poor child has increased. The disparities are great, making application of uniform TANF work participation standards to all states without adjustment for variation in resources questionable. The article concludes with an exploration of the connection between TANF resources and state fiscal capacity and a discussion of options for reform.",

Yet little is known about how these factors interact to influence smoking behaviors, including cessation. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to estimate the variance in cessation service utilization among a sample of primarily African American adults accounted for by individual, social, and neighborhood factors. Findings showed individual and social factors were important predictors of cessation service utilization. Social contexts have significant effects on smoking cessation service use, and social influences were more significant predictors of cessation service use than neighborhood factors.",

        "abstract": "Experience of material hardship can adversely affect a family's ability to make long-term investments in children's development. We examine whether material hardship is associated with one indicator of such investments: participation in a tax-advantaged college savings plan (529 plan). Data for this study come from the SEED for Oklahoma Kids (SEED OK) experiment, an intervention that offers Child Development Accounts with financial incentives to encourage the accumulation of college savings for children from the time of their birth. Results show that material hardship is negatively associated with 529-plan participation, and this association varies by treatment status. At all levels of material hardship, treatment-group mothers are more likely to hold accounts than control-group mothers. These findings suggest that CDAs can be a useful policy tool to support families' financial preparation for college.",

        "abstract": "Importance Severe obesity in childhood is associated with negative health consequences. A previous study examined trends in severe obesity among preschool-aged children in low-income families during 1998 to 2010. No recent trends have been reported. Objective To examine trends in severe obesity by age, sex, and race/ethnicity among enrollees in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) aged 2 to 4 years during 2000 to 2014. Design, Setting, and Participants Serial cross-sectional data from 22.6 million young children enrolled in WIC from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 5 US territories from 2000 to 2014. Data analysis was conducted from February 16, 2017, to March 9, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of severe obesity. Severe obesity was defined as a sex-specific body mass index-for-age 120% or more of the 95th percentile on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Children’s weights and heights were measured. Children whose sex, weight, height, or body mass index was missing or biologically implausible were excluded. Results The prevalence of severe obesity was 1.96% in 2014. During 2000 to 2004, the prevalence increased significantly overall from 1.80% to 2.11% (adjusted prevalence difference [APD], 0.26%) and among all the age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups except for Asian/Pacific Islander (APD, 0.05%-0.54% across groups with increases). The largest relative increase occurred in children aged 4 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR], 1.21) and non-Hispanic white (APR, 1.22) and American Indian/Alaska Native children (APR, 1.19). During 2004 to 2010, the prevalence decreased significantly overall (APD, −0.05%), among boys, children aged 2 and 3 years, and non-Hispanic black and Asian/Pacific Islander children (APD, −0.05% to −0.18%). During 2010 to 2014, the prevalence decreased significantly overall from 2.12% to 1.96% (APD, −0.14%) and among all demographic groups (APD, −0.04% to −0.30% across groups). The largest relative decrease occurred in children aged 2 years (APR, 0.88) and Hispanic (APR, 0.92), American Indian/Alaska Native (APR, 0.89), and Asian/Pacific Islander (APR, 0.87) children. Conclusions and Relevance This study provides updated prevalence and trends of severe obesity among young children enrolled in WIC and reports recent modest declines in severe obesity in all subgroups. Ongoing surveillance can assess whether declines continue into the future among low-income children.",

This longitudinal study followed a random sample of 2-1-1 callers in Missouri (n=1,235) to determine the results of the referrals they received. One month after calling 2-1-1, most remembered receiving (93%), tried contacting (91%) and reached (82%) at least one referral they received. Far fewer (36%) received assistance from the referral, ranging from 17% for housing assistance to 67% for food assistance. Callers receiving assistance were much more likely than those not receiving assistance to report at 1-month follow-up that their problem had been resolved (OR=3.0, 95% CI=2.2, 4.1), although this was less true among callers with multiple unmet basic needs. Findings explain how 2-1-1 helps callers resolve problems, but also identifies missed opportunities in the current system. Future research could elucidate how 2-1-1 callers resolve problems and find ways to improve outcomes for the most disadvantaged 2-1-1 callers.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo examine the prevalence of child and family characteristics associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in Hispanic children in immigrant families compared with Hispanic children in US-native families.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were from the nationally representative 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health. Parent-reported child ACE exposure was classified as no ACEs (0), low ACEs (1), or high ACEs (≥2). By using multinomial logistic regression, we evaluated the odds of low or high ACE exposure versus no ACE exposure by immigrant family status and child and family characteristics (eg, insurance status, child health status, or household-to-income ratio).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study sample included 12 162 Hispanic children. More children in immigrant families lived ≤200% of the federal poverty level compared with children in US-native families (80% vs 47%, respectively; P < .001). Thirty percent of children in US-native families reported high ACEs compared with only 16% of children in immigrant families (P < .001). The odds of high ACE exposure versus no ACE exposure for children in immigrant families compared with US-native children was 0.46 (95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.61). Child and family characteristics did not explain the difference in odds of ACE exposure by immigrant family status.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren in immigrant families had significantly lower odds of ACE exposure despite higher prevalence of poverty. This may not reflect a true health advantage in this population. There may be unmeasured factors that buffer children in immigrant families from ACE exposure, or ACE questions may not capture the adverse experiences specific to immigrant families.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion improved access to health insurance among low-income populations. We sought to examine the spillover benefits of the ACA Medicaid expansion on ability to afford rent/mortgage and purchase of nutritious meals.MethodsUsing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) we analyzed individuals aged 18–64 years residing in 12 U.S. states (including five ACA Medicaid expansion states) in 2015. Our treatment of interest was access to health insurance, instrumented by the ACA Medicaid expansion. Our outcome variables were: worry or stress about having sufficient money to pay the rent or mortgage and to purchase nutritious meals. We conducted a two-stage least squares instrumental variables regression.ResultsA 10%-point increase in the proportion of those who obtained health insurance following the ACA Medicaid expansion reduced the probability of being worried and stressed related to purchasing nutritious meals by 7.2% points (95% CI: 1.3–13.2) as well as paying the rent or mortgage by 8.6% points (95% CI: 2.5–14.7) among people living below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The ACA Medicaid expansion was not associated with access to health insurance among those living over 138% of FPL, and obtaining health insurance did not influence stress or worry in relation to affording rent/mortgage or meals in this income group.ConclusionsImproved access to health insurance contributed to reducing worry and stress associated with paying rent/mortgage or purchasing meals among low-income people. Expanding health insurance access may have contributed to increasing the disposable income of low income groups.",

Descriptive analyses and logistic regression analysis are used to estimate food insufficiency and its correlates by complexity of children's special healthcare needs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis showed that children with more complex special healthcare needs experienced roughly twice the rate of food insufficiency compared with children with no special healthcare needs or children with less complex healthcare needs. Multivariate analysis indicated that children with more complex healthcare needs face an increased risk of food insufficiency net of demographic and economic characteristics. Interaction models revealed that medical home access protects children with medical complexity from food insufficiency.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings document significantly elevated risk of food insufficiency among families with a child facing more complex special healthcare needs. Interventions in healthcare settings could include referrals to resources already in place to combat hunger such as food bank agencies and other resources that might help at-risk families obtain assistance through programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Women, Infants, and Children.",

        "abstract": "Former prisoners are at high risk of economic insecurity due to the challenges they face in finding employment and to the difficulties of securing and maintaining public assistance while incarcerated. This study examines the processes through which former prisoners attain economic security, examining how they meet basic material needs and achieve upward mobility over time. It draws on unique qualitative data from in-depth, unstructured interviews with a sample of former prisoners followed over a two to three year period to assess how subjects draw upon a combination of employment, social supports, and public benefits to make ends meet. Findings reveal considerable struggle among our subjects to meet even minimal needs for shelter and food, although economic security and stability could be attained when employment or public benefits were coupled with familial social support. Sustained economic security was rarely achieved absent either strong social support or access to long-term public benefits. However, a select few were able to leverage material support and social networks into trajectories of upward mobility and economic independence. Policy implications are discussed.",

Statistical analyses were adjusted for child and adult sociodemographic measures as well as adult psychosocial and lifestyle factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWomen who grew up in economically disadvantaged families and who received public assistance during childhood had a 66% decreased odds of hypertension by mid-life compared with women similarly disadvantaged in childhood but who did not receive public assistance, odds ratio = 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.14-0.83. No association was observed for African American men.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nReceipt of anti-poverty federal assistance during childhood was associated with reduced risk for hypertension by mid-life among African American women. It is possible that social expenditures on public assistance programs for families in need could produce long-term health benefits for children.",

        "abstract": "E-government has promised to deliver government services faster and with greater efficiency and transparency, reduce costs, engage the public as government partners, and serve as a democratizing agent. But rather than leverage e-government to examine the assumptions and presumptions that are part of the existing manual processes to deliver services to the poor, those processes have been automated without deep consideration of the recipients' needs and barriers to access, privacy or civil rights, or building in solid data points to measure their effectiveness. This paper examines the legislative framework that supports the most common public assistance programs and other e-government policies that have indirectly impacted the poor. It identifies several successes in easing living in poverty and suggests several points in the legislation that could help bring the poor to fuller engagement and reduce invisibility within the government.",

A total of 63% of condom and withdrawal users and 78% of nonusers preferred a more effective method. Many noted cost and insurance barriers as reasons for not using their preferred more-effective method.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMany young women in this sample who relied on less-effective methods preferred to use more-effective contraception. Reducing barriers could lead to higher uptake in this population at high risk of unintended pregnancy.",

Data are from a household random sample of 1,510 individuals 18-64 years of age. A total of 20.9% of children in sample households were exposed to an adult with an alcohol problem, and 5.7% were exposed to an adult with DSM-5 AUD. These considerable proportions suggest that alcohol treatment and family support programs should include help for adults in the family, and special support for exposed children in the household.",

        "abstract": "Several previous papers have marked the United States as an outlier: high poverty rates, low public social spending but high private social expenditures; a rather strong belief that people are poor because of laziness or lack of will; and remarkable differences across the States due to state discretion. With that established context in mind, this paper analyzes U.S. welfare in more detail, focusing on the impact of TANF – part of the major welfare reform that took place in the United States in 1996. U.S. welfare reform emphasized an American preference for work, and it was a move further away from the strategies other “wealthy” nations use to address poverty. Initially U.S. welfare reform did serve to increase work participation rates, although the earnings of most individuals who left welfare were still below the poverty line, even many years after their exit. We found huge variation of welfare eligibility rights across states, depending on the state’s ability to pay and preferences to meet a certain level of social standard or other (social) objectives such as child care, work support and employment programs.",

        "abstract": "Medicaid provides health insurance for 54 million Americans. Using the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure (which subtracts out-of-pocket medical expenses from family resources), we estimated the impact of eliminating Medicaid. In our counterfactual, Medicaid beneficiaries would become uninsured or gain other insurance. Counterfactual medical expenditures were drawn stochastically from propensity-score-matched individuals without Medicaid. While this method captures the importance of risk protection, it likely underestimates Medicaid's impact due to unobserved differences between Medicaid and non-Medicaid individuals. Nonetheless, we find that Medicaid reduces out-of-pocket medical spending from $871 to $376 per beneficiary, and decreases poverty rates by 1.0% among children, 2.2% among disabled adults, and 0.7% among elderly individuals. When factoring in institutionalized populations, an additional 500,000 people were kept out of poverty. Overall, Medicaid kept at least 2.6 million-and as many as 3.4 million-out of poverty in 2010, making it the U.S.'s third largest anti-poverty program.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Fresh Start (WFS) is a randomized controlled trial of nutrition education to promote farmers' market fruit and vegetable (F/V) purchases and consumption among women enrolled in WIC.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo describe the baseline characteristics (demographics and F/V intake [including F/V juice]) of WFS participants, compare the characteristics with those of WIC participants in New Jersey and nationwide, and examine the baseline reliability of study measures.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nSeven hundred forty-four women served by a New Jersey-based WIC agency located in a densely populated, urban area.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nDemographic characteristics; newly developed measures of farmers' market-related knowledge, attitudes, and skills; and validated measures of F/V intake.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES\nDescriptive statistics to characterize the sample. One-sample t and one-sample sign tests to compare the characteristics with reference values. For dietary behaviors, comparisons were with state and national estimates of the frequency and quantity of F/V intake.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants had a mean age of 28.9±6.8 years and were predominantly Hispanic (59%), US-born (60%), never married (41%), unemployed (62%), receiving assistance other than WIC (70%), and food insecure (55%). Half reported a high school education or less. Higher proportions of WFS participants than WIC participants nationwide were represented among demographic groups at increased risk of inadequate F/V intake. WFS participants consumed more fruit (2.7 cups/day) but less vegetables (1.4 cups/day) than did women nationwide (1.1 and 1.4 cups/day, respectively; P<0.01). Although participants consumed recommended amounts of fruit, their vegetable intake was below recommended levels. All but two of the measures developed for the study had reliability coefficients at or above 0.60.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIntervention is warranted to improve participants' vegetable intake. Registered dietitian nutritionists should be aware of F/V intake differences that may require differential intervention strategies.",

        "abstract": "Farmworker family members risk poor mental health due to stressors including poverty, relocation, and documentation status. This paper explores the relationship between farm-work related stressors and depressive symptoms in women of Latino farmworker families. 248 mothers of young children completed fixed-response interviews in Spanish. Measures included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, Migrant Farmworker Stress Inventory, and USDA Household Food Security Survey Module. Bivariate analyses indicated greater depressive symptoms with more economic hardship, more farm work-related stressors, greater age, and being unmarried. In multivariable logistic regression, economic hardship remained the only factor associated with depressive symptoms. Greater economic hardship, but not general farm work-related stress, is a main factor associated with depression in women of Latino farmworker families. Maternal depression can have consequences for both mothers and families. Mental health services for women in farmworker families should be targeted to those with the greatest economic challenges.",

The proposed mechanism connects TANF participants, during the intake process and by default, to a low-fee or no-fee TANF bank account. Low- and moderate-income (LMI) families, especially those receiving public assistance benefits, face significant barriers to accessing and sustaining bank accounts at conventional financial institutions. Nationally, 28 percent of households with incomes less than $15,000 are unbanked, as are 12 percent of households with incomes between $15,000 and $30,000. In addition, the percentages of households that are underbanked are 22 and 26 percent in these two income groups, respectively (Burhouse and Osaki 2012). Underbanked households have bank accounts but also use nonbanking financial services such as payday loans. Families need both better access to financial services and concrete opportunities to build their financial knowledge and skills.",

Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development ISSN: 2152-0801 online https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org 134 Volume 8, Issue 1 / Spring 2018 completed the anonymous, 51-question survey. The survey measured demographics, perceived barriers and promotional opportunities within constructs of the Social Ecological Model (SEM). We used descriptive statistics to summarize characteristics, and chi-square, Mann-Whitney U and ttests to analyze differences in characteristics between those farmers who accept SNAP and those who do not. The most frequently cited barriers to SNAP acceptance included lack of internet access, increased burden for processing payments, increased need for bookkeeping, limited availability of information about the application process and payment system, limited support from the market for completing the application, a small customer base and limited number of SNAP clientele. Comparative analyses revealed statistically significant differences in demographics and perceived barriers between those who accept SNAP and those who do not. Findings from this study provide a more in-depth understanding of challenges farmers face in accepting SNAP. These can be addressed through education, policy, systems and environmental solutions at various levels of the SEM to overcome barriers to SNAP acceptance, ultimately increasing access to and affordability of fruits and vegetables for low-income communities.",

        "abstract": "Summary:Food assistance programs —including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps), the National School Lunch Program, and the School Breakfast Program —have been remarkably successful at their core mission: reducing food insecurity among low-income children. Moreover, writes Craig Gundersen, SNAP in particular has also been shown to reduce poverty, improve birth outcomes and children’s health generally, and increase survival among low-weight infants. Thus these programs are a crucial component of the United States’ social safety net for health.Recent years have seen proposals to alter these programs to achieve additional goals, such as reducing childhood obesity. Two popular ideas are to restrict what recipients can purchase with SNAP benefits and to change the composition of school meals, in an effort to change eating patterns. Gundersen shows that these proposed changes are unlikely to reduce childhood obesity yet are likely to have the unintended effect of damaging the programs’ core mission by reducing participation and thus increasing food insecurity among children.On the other hand, Gundersen writes, policy makers could contemplate certain changes that would make food assistance programs even more effective. For example, lawmakers could revisit the SNAP benefit formula, which hasn’t changed for decades, to make certain that aid is going to those who need it most. Similarly, the School Breakfast Program could be expanded to cover more children, and summer meal programs could reach more children when school isn’t in session.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the extent to which geographic variation in Food Stamp Program (FSP) participation is explained by place-based factors, with special attention to the case of the three poorest regions of the United States: Central Appalachia, the Texas Borderland, and the Lower Mississippi Delta. We use descriptive statistics and regression models to assess the prevalence and correlates of county-level FSP participation circa 2005. Our findings show that the economic distress that has long characterized Appalachia, the Borderland, and the Delta clearly translates into greater reliance on the FSP relative to other areas of the country. State-level effects and local-level variations in poverty, labor market conditions, population structure, human capital, and residential context explain much of this reality. Yet, even after taking all of these factors into account, these regional geographies remain home to particularly high FSP participation. Our findings underscore the importance of considering these regions as key cases of study in the stratification of American society and hold a variety of implications for public policy.",

        "abstract": "Researchers have long known that poverty in childhood is linked with a range of negative adult socioeconomic outcomes, from lower educational achievement and behavioral problems to lower earnings in the labor market. But few researchers have explored whether exposure to a disadvantaged background affects immigrant children and native children differently. George Borjas uses Current Population Survey (CPS) data on two specific indicators of poverty—the poverty rate and the rate of participation in public assistance programs—to begin answering that question.He finds that immigrant children have significantly higher rates both of poverty and of program participation than do native children. Nearly half of immigrant children are being raised in households that receive some type of public assistance, compared with roughly one-third of native children. Although the shares of immigrant and native children living in poverty are lower, the rate for immigrant children is nonetheless about 15 percentage points higher than that for native children—about the same as the gap in public assistance. Poverty and program participation rates among different groups of immigrant children also vary widely, depending in part on place of birth (foreign- or U.S.-born), parents (immigrant or native), and national origin. According to the CPS data, these native-immigrant differences persist into young adulthood. In particular, the program participation and poverty status of immigrant children is strongly correlated with their program participation and poverty status when they become young adults. But it is not possible, says Borjas, to tell whether the link results from a set of permanent factors associated with specific individuals or groups that tends to lead to \"good\" or \"bad\" outcomes systematically over time or from exposure during childhood to adverse socioeconomic outcomes, such as poverty or welfare dependency. Future research must explore the causal impact of childhood poverty on immigrant adult outcomes and why it might differ between immigrant and native families. Developing successful policies to address problems caused by the intergenerational breeding of poverty and program participation in the immigrant population depends on understanding this causal mechanism.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the interplay between two important public programs for vulnerable children: Medicaid and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Children's public health insurance eligibility increased dramatically during the late 1990s with the launch of the Children's Health Insurance Program along with concurrent Medicaid expansions. We use a measure of simulated eligibility as an exogenous source of variation in Medicaid generosity to identify the effects of the eligibility expansions on SSI outcomes. Though increases in eligibility for public health insurance did not affect contemporaneous youth SSI applications or awards on average, expansions in coverage significantly decreased both applications and awards in states where SSI recipients did not automatically receive Medicaid. We attribute the difference in findings to the higher transactions costs associated with entering Medicaid via SSI in such states. In the long-term, increased public insurance eligibility during childhood reduces young adult SSI applications to some extent, consistent with recent findings that Medicaid coverage in youth improves adult health and economic outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Pregnant women are likely to be sensitive to daily fluctuations in nutritional intake. To see if income constraints at the end of the month limit food consumption and trigger health problems, we examine how the date that benefits are issued for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) changes the probability that a woman will go to the Emergency Room (ER) for pregnancy-related conditions using administrative data from SNAP and Medicaid from Missouri for 2010–2013. SNAP benefits in Missouri are distributed from the 1st through the 22nd day of the month based on the birth month and the first letter of the last name of the head of the household, making timing of SNAP issuance exogenous. We estimate probit models of the calendar month and SNAP benefit month on the probability of a pregnancy-related ER visit for women age 17–45, or the sample at risk of being pregnant. We also examine the relationship between SNAP benefit levels and ER visits. We found that women who received SNAP benefits in the second or third week of the calendar month were less likely to receive pregnancy-related care through the ER in the week following benefit receipt. Results suggest that SNAP benefits might be related to patterns of pregnancy-related medical care accessed through the ER. Since SNAP issuance date is within state control in the United States, states may want to consider the health effects of their choice.",

A sample of 6,737 parents was extracted from the public-use data set titled “National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.” Results showed that restrictive TANF policies reduced African Americans’ likelihood of welfare use and increased likelihood of their financial independence. Multinomial logistic results also showed that, among Hispanics, employment growth in neighboring counties promoted welfare use; whereas among Caucasians such growth promoted financial independence. County poverty increased (a) Caucasians’ likelihood of welfare use and (b) Hispanics’ likelihood of being working poor; it decreased Caucasians’ and African Americans’ likelihood of financial independence. Across ethnic groups, education reduced likelihood of welfare use and working poor status; across minority groups, education increased likelihood of fina...",

        "abstract": "The safety net that immigrants face today differs significantly from the immediate post-Welfare Reform era in terms of eligibility and economic context. To inform debates on immigrant access to the safety net, this paper examines implications of the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act, which restored food stamp eligibility to nearly two-thirds of immigrants who lost eligibility under Welfare Reform. Using data from the 1995-2013 Current Population Survey and a difference-in-difference design, I examine how restoration efforts have influenced food stamp participation and food insecurity rates among low-income Mexican immigrant households with children. I then examine trends in food stamp receipt across policy and economic changes since Welfare Reform. Overall, results suggest that immigrant restoration efforts have reversed some but not all of the negative consequences of Welfare Reform and that immigrant households' use of food stamps has increased, particularly in the wake of the Great Recession.",

Yet not all eligible households participate, and disparities in participation exist by household size, race, ethnicity, and place. We examine the county-level associations between maximum benefit levels and SNAP enrollment by household size, race, ethnicity, and metropolitan status from 2007 to 2013 in the state of Georgia. National county-level data on participation in SNAP by racial or ethnic group are not available, but Georgia features substantial variation by race and ethnicity as well as metropolitan status at the county level that make it well suited for our analysis. Maximum SNAP benefit levels were associated with increases in county-level SNAP enrollment across the board but especially for single-person households, Hispanics, and rural Whites. These findings have implications for future changes to SNAP benefits.",

        "abstract": "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 famously “ended welfare as we [knew] it” by replacing the state-operated Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program with a revised funding scheme called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). In the summer of 2012, controversy erupted over a memorandum issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), concerning state options for TANF performance reporting. Opponents of the Obama administration claimed the policy initiative specified in the memorandum signaled a fundamental change in direction of the national welfare policy established by PRWORA—that it “gutted” welfare reform. The memorandum has not (as of 2016) been rescinded, and the issues raised in the ensuing controversy remain unresolved. We review the controversy. We argue that while there is some justification in criticism of the Obama administration's strategy, the initiative addressed an important problem: the inadequacy of the program's performance measure given the variation in resources available to states in meeting the program's goals. The ACF memo was in our judgment a responsible step toward finding methods for improving TANF performance and, as conducted, the guts debate retarded this search.",

This review describes time trends in health inequalities (by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status), commitments to reduce health inequalities, and progress made to eliminate health inequalities in the United States, United Kingdom, and other OECD countries. Time-trend data in the United States indicate a narrowing of the gap between the best- and worst-off groups in some health indicators, such as life expectancy, but a widening of the gap in others, such as diabetes prevalence. Similarly, time-trend data in the United Kingdom indicate a narrowing of the gap between the best- and worst-off groups in some indicators, such as hypertension prevalence, whereas the gap between social classes has increased for life expectancy. More research and better methods are needed to measure precisely the relationships between stated policy goals and observed trends in health inequalities.",

        "abstract": "Food security occurs when all members of a household have reliable access to food in sufficient quantity and quality to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle. Given the important biological and social value of food for humans, food and food sufficiency have been traditional topics of study among biological anthropologists. The focus on food insecurity, however, has emerged within the past two decades and recent global events, including the food crisis of 2007/2008, have led to renewed interests in the topic of food insecurity and wellbeing. Here, we review current and novel threats to food security, current thinking on measurement and definitions, and then outline a model that links food insecurity to coping strategies and then to health outcomes. We suggest that coping strategies are typically context-specific and can be food and nonfood based. We further suggest that coping strategies may impact health quite broadly, not just through nutritional pathways. We then review available data on the relationship between food insecurity and nutritional status, chronic diseases, infectious diseases, and mental health. Our review highlights the far reaching consequences of food insecurity for human wellbeing but also the considerable variability in its effect and our limited empirical knowledge of the pathways through which food insecurity impacts health. We conclude by offering thoughts on how biological anthropologists might contribute to growing our understanding of food insecurity and human health and wellbeing.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS) among women with a recent live birth and specifically among women participating in and eligible for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System data from 22 states in 2006–2008 (n = 75,234) were used to estimate the prevalence of PDS using a two-question screener. Associations between PDS and respondent demographics, risk factors and behaviors, and WIC program eligibility and participation were assessed using logistic regression. Overall prevalence of PDS was 13.8 %:19.8 % among WIC participants, 16.3 % among non-participants eligible for WIC, and 6.8 % of women not eligible for the program. PDS prevalence was higher among younger, less educated, and poorer women, as well as those engaging in risky behaviors during pregnancy (smoking and binge drinking), and those with an unintended pregnancy and who experienced intimate partner violence during pregnancy. Controlling for these factors, the odds of PDS were no different between WIC participants and women eligible but not participating in the program (aOR 1.08, 95 % CI 0.97–1.22), but WIC enrollees were significantly more likely than ineligible women to report PDS (aOR 1.65, 95 % CI 1.39–1.95). WIC serves more than 1 million pregnant women each year, one-fifth of whom may experience PDS. WIC has a unique opportunity to screen and provide referrals to new mothers receiving postpartum WIC benefits.",

        "abstract": "Many farmers markets are now accepting federal nutrition assistance benefits through programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), allowing program participants to use their benefits for purchasing locally grown fruits and vegetables. Select farmers markets that accept SNAP benefits offer nutrition education through recipe testing, cooking demonstrations, and recipe cards for market patrons. Minimal data, however, have been collected to determine the effectiveness of the educational materials used at farmers markets. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) program through Utah State University Extension collected initial and follow-up data from farmers market patrons through directly administered questionnaires. These questionnaires measured the impact of the food samples, recipe cards, and produce information posters shared with SNAP and non-SNAP participants at six Utah farmers markets in 2014 and 2015. Farmers market vendors were also surveyed to determine the influence of the SNAP-Ed booth on food sales and market value. Results of this study show that SNAP participants ( n =140) are significantly more likely ( p <0.05) than non-SNAP participants ( n =917) to be influenced by the educational strategies utilized at the SNAP-Ed farmers market booth. Market vendors also reported increased produce sales as a result of having the SNAP-Ed booth at the market. Offering nutrition education at farmers markets that accept SNAP benefits is one way to educate low-income shoppers on how to select, store, and prepare local produce; it may also increase the overall amount of produce purchased at the market.",

        "abstract": "Poverty is a major social problem in the United States: in 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau reported 46.7 million people living in poverty and an estimated 14.8 percent poverty rate. The poverty rate has been steadily increasing in the United States, with a 2 percent increase in 2012 over 2007. Federal and state governments have initiated many anti-poverty programs, starting with the New Deal Program in the 1930s. With the advent of a new governance approach in the 1990s, many hierarchical bureaucratic government agencies were replaced with public, private, network, and collaborative approaches to solve this complex national problem. Tax expenditures, vouchers, and grants are the three major governance tools used by the U.S. federal and state governments to fight poverty. This article addresses three important programs—the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)—used in fighting poverty in the United States and discusses the problem of poverty, the effectiveness of these governance tools, suggestions for future research, and policy implications",

Because the program (and its predecessor Food Stamp Program) was not designed for this purpose, the result is a program that has many unintended and, many believe, negative effects. The key challenge is to modernize a massive income support program that started as a small food assistance program. The author proposes an effort to rationalize the current patchwork of programs that make up the U.S. safety net—in a way that balances what looks to be long-term weak demand for labor with the need to minimize the work and marriage disincentives in current law.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper introduces a research agenda to explore the intersection of e-government implementation and the key federal programs – Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, a.k.a. food stamps), (SSI), and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF, a.k.a. welfare) – that provide assistance to low-income citizens in the United States. To lay the groundwork for on-going research, this paper focuses on the implementing statutes that require different levels of automation for delivering these programs to the public. It discusses the programs in terms of their breadth, impacts to recipients, and the effects of automation as implemented for each. It identifies some of the consequences of automation, such as potentially faster service delivery, different approaches to information access, and issues of privacy. It then suggests some points to consider for policymakers and for future research to more deeply understand this unique and little-studied aspect of e-government implementation. By understanding the impacts of implementing statutes on the poor, policymakers can develop a deliberately inclusive strategy that leverages technology to support access to assistance in measurable models that can be implemented at the federal, state, and county levels. This can further democratize the government-to-citizen relationship and support greater accountability to taxpayers.",

As chief economist (CHECO) at the U.S. Department of Labor, however, I quickly learned that my quantitative skills and economic training were extremely helpful in informing current and future policymaking in three ways.First, during my tenure as CHECO, I found out that descriptive work on previous and current trends in participation, employment, vacancies, turnover, and earnings was key to understanding the basic challenges facing the labor market and to identifying what types of policies were needed to solve these challenges. Second, my knowledge of credible evidence on which specific interventions to address the main challenges currently facing the labor market have and have not worked in the past was crucial to developing policies addressing the pressing needs in the labor market. Third, my knowledge of the labor literature and impact evaluation helped me to identify new areas where research was needed and to set up experiments and research that could help answer those questions.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, 5.3 million children and adolescents are growing up either with unauthorized status or with at least one parent who has that status. Until recently, little in the way of research has informed federal, state, and local policy debates related to unauthorized status (e.g., border enforcement, deportation, and a pathway to citizenship) although these issues have important implications for youth development. This statement is a brief summary of the research evidence on multiple domains of development that may be affected by the child or parent's unauthorized status. We also describe the contextual and psychological mechanisms that may link this status to developmental outcomes. We summarize a range of policies and practices that could reduce the developmental harm to children, youth, and their families stemming from this status. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for policy, practice, and research that are based on the evidence reviewed.",

        "abstract": "The Census Bureau is partnering with state public assistance agencies to acquire program participation data and estimate new statistics that deepen a state’s understanding of program participants and improve outreach efforts to those who are eligible but do not participate. In collaboration with the Economic Research Service and the Food and Nutrition Service within the United States Department of Agriculture, the Census Bureau obtains individual-level program participation administrative records (AR) data for three state programs, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). The Census Bureau constructs a unique data set for each state program by linking the AR data to survey response data for the same individuals. These linked data enable the Census Bureau to model which survey respondents are eligible for program participation and also to observe which eligible individuals participate in the program. The Census Bureau then estimates eligibility and participation rates by a variety of demographic and economic characteristics and by county. The individual-level data also enable the Census Bureau to construct a statistical profile of eligible individuals and families that do not participate to assist state agencies with their outreach programs. All statistical results provided back to state agencies in table reports and data visualizations are reviewed to insure that individual identities are protected and not disclosed. This paper will present results for several state programs that have partnered the Census Bureau.",

        "abstract": "Placed-based development theory assumes that assets and liabilities within a geographical context matter for community development. Drawing on this framework, this article argues that the United States Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at farmers markets is an underutilized asset for community development. Therefore, community developers should explore this asset to better develop sustainable farmers markets. The authors utilized the US National Farmers Market Directory and the SNAP Data System to determine if SNAP beneficiaries had access to use Electronic Benefit Transaction (EBT) cards at farmers markets in Mississippi. The findings indicate that SNAP accessibility at farmers markets remains an underutilized resource for capturing consumer spending and capitalizing on the local multiplier effect. The authors recommend that policy-makers and community developers enact and implement public policies that will: (1) assist farmers and farmers markets with enhancing SNAP accessibility by installing EBT card readers, (2) establish local coordination that will assist in supporting the utilization of SNAP benefits at farmers markets, and (3) incentivize SNAP beneficiaries to shop at local farmers markets by initiating \"matching dollar\" programs.",

        "abstract": "Rising economic insecurity in recent decades has focused attention on the importance of social welfare programs in managing household financial stability. Some governments are more effective than others in managing this outcome, and informal social institutions help explain why. Social capital is expected to shape economic security through multiple mechanisms, but whether the effect is to magnify or mitigate volatility is an open question. Part of the answer has to do with how social capital interacts with policy implementation, and whether it conditions the effectiveness of government spending. Evidence from the U.S. states from 1986 to 2010 fails to support a benevolent social capital thesis-not only is social capital associated with greater economic insecurity, there is no evidence that it improves social welfare effectiveness. However, greater spending on some social programs can mitigate the adverse impact of social capital on economic security.",

This longitudinal study explores patterns and barriers for engaging treatment services during early reentry. Seventy-five men and 62 women in jail, prison, or community based correctional facilities (CBCFs) participated in pre- and post-release interviews. Findings indicate that services were engaged at a lower-than-needed rate and barriers were greater for individuals leaving jails compared to prison or CBCF. Exploratory factor analysis of the barriers instrument is presented. Implications for extending service access to this population are discussed, as are future directions for research.",

        "abstract": "With the national push to expand preschool education, there has been growing interest in understanding why Latino families are enrolled in preschool at lower rates than non-Latino families. This study applied the accommodations model by Meyers and Jordan (2006) to the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (n = 5,850) to provide a more nuanced understanding of the preschool selection of U.S.- and foreign-born Latino families. Results from this investigation underscored the similarities and differences that existed in the selection behaviors of different groups of families, while also highlighting important differences within the Latino population. In general, these differences within the Latino population cut across community language use, child factors, and parents' beliefs about school readiness. Moreover, after accounting for the various selection factors, there were no longer any consistent differences in the preschool enrollment rates between Latino children and their Black and White peers. When taken together, these findings suggest that careful attention must be paid to the heterogeneity in the experiences of Latino families in navigating the preschool market.",

        "abstract": "The healthcare sector was one of the few sectors of the US economy that created new positions in spite of the recent economic downturn. Economic contractions are associated with worsening morbidity and mortality, declining private health insurance coverage, and budgetary pressure on public health programs. This study examines the causes of healthcare employment growth and workforce composition in the US and evaluates the labor market’s impact on healthcare spending and health outcomes. Data are collected for 50 states and the District of Columbia from 1999–2009. Labor market and healthcare workforce data are obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mortality and health status data are collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vital Statistics program and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Healthcare spending data are derived from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dynamic panel data regression models, with instrumental variables, are used to examine the effect of the labor market on healthcare spending, morbidity, and mortality. Regression analysis is also performed to model the effects of healthcare spending on the healthcare workforce composition. All statistical tests are based on a two-sided $$\\alpha $$α significance of $$p\\,<$$p< .05. Analyses are performed with STATA and SAS. The labor force participation rate shows a more robust effect on healthcare spending, morbidity, and mortality than the unemployment rate. Study results also show that declining labor force participation negatively impacts overall health status ($$p\\,<$$p< .01), and mortality for males ($$p\\,<$$p< .05) and females ($$p\\,<$$p< .001), aged 16–64. Further, the Medicaid and Medicare spending share increases as labor force participation declines ($$p\\,<$$p< .001); whereas, the private healthcare spending share decreases ($$p\\,<$$p< .001). Public and private healthcare spending also has a differing effect on healthcare occupational employment per 100,000 people. Private healthcare spending positively impacts primary care physician employment ($$p\\,<$$p< .001); whereas, Medicare spending drives up employment of physician assistants, registered nurses, and personal care attendants ($$p\\,<$$p< .001). Medicaid and Medicare spending has a negative effect on surgeon employment ($$p\\,<$$p< .05); the effect of private healthcare spending is positive but not statistically significant. Labor force participation, as opposed to unemployment, is a better proxy for measuring the effect of the economic environment on healthcare spending and health outcomes. Further, during economic contractions, Medicaid and Medicare’s share of overall healthcare spending increases with meaningful effects on the configuration of state healthcare workforces and subsequently, provision of care for populations at-risk for worsening morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThere is little research on factors associated with alcohol consumption among Puerto Ricans living in the USA; thus the aim of the present study was to examine alcohol intake patterns, and factors associated with drinking categories, in a cohort of Puerto Rican adults in Massachusetts.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional study. Descriptive and polytomous logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with drinking patterns, stratified by gender.\n\n\nSETTING\nGreater Boston area, MA, USA.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nPuerto Rican adults (n 1292), aged 45-75 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEight per cent of men and 39% of women were lifetime abstainers; 40% of men and 25% of women were former drinkers; 31 % of men and 27% of women were moderate drinkers; and 21% of men and 8% of women were heavy drinkers. Thirty-five per cent of participants reported drinking alcohol while taking medications with alcohol contraindications. After multivariable adjustment, young men were less likely than older men to be moderate drinkers. Among women, higher BMI, age, lower income and lower psychological acculturation were associated with abstention; age and lower perceived emotional support were associated with increased likelihood of former drinking; and women without v. with diabetes were more likely to be heavy drinkers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh prevalence of chronic disease, heavy drinking and alcohol use while taking medications with alcohol contraindications suggest an urgent need for better screening and interventions tailored to this rapidly growing Hispanic national subgroup. As heavy drinking appears to increase with acculturation for women, public health initiatives are needed to support appropriate alcohol use.",

        "abstract": "Although spending rates on health care and social services vary substantially across the states, little is known about the possible association between variation in state-level health outcomes and the allocation of state spending between health care and social services. To estimate that association, we used state-level repeated measures multivariable modeling for the period 2000-09, with region and time fixed effects adjusted for total spending and state demographic and economic characteristics and with one- and two-year lags. We found that states with a higher ratio of social to health spending (calculated as the sum of social service spending and public health spending divided by the sum of Medicare spending and Medicaid spending) had significantly better subsequent health outcomes for the following seven measures: adult obesity; asthma; mentally unhealthy days; days with activity limitations; and mortality rates for lung cancer, acute myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes. Our study suggests that broadening the debate beyond what should be spent on health care to include what should be invested in health-not only in health care but also in social services and public health-is warranted.",

        "abstract": "The Great Recession has been distinctive in driving up unprecedented levels of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This study extends the literature on the geography of SNAP receipt by (1) examining change in SNAP receipt across US counties during the Great Recession and (2) identifying how changes in other local characteristics were associated with this outcome. Our analysis draws on data from the US Department of Agriculture and other secondary sources. We use descriptive statistics, mapping, and weighted least squares spatial regression models to examine county-level variation (N = 2,485) in the percentage-point change in SNAP receipt between 2007 and 2009. Our findings reveal substantial local-level variation in the change in SNAP stamp use during the downturn. We find that counties with the greatest levels of change in SNAP participation tend to be regionally clustered. Our regression analysis shows that areas where the signature characteristics of the Great Recession were most pronounced (i.e., home foreclosures and unemployment) were precisely the places where SNAP use jumped most, not places with historically high levels of SNAP participation. Overall, this study demonstrates that change in SNAP receipt was geographically uneven during the Great Recession, and that local and regional configurations matter in shaping this variation. These results hold a range of implications for public policy, including opportunities for regionally targeted outreach and investment in SNAP and the use of the program as a responsive form of local stimulus during periods of economic crisis.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundOf the 4.8 million uninsured children in America, 62–72% are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. Not enough is known, however, about the impact of health insurance on outcomes and costs for previously uninsured children, which has never been examined prospectively.MethodsThis prospective observational study of uninsured Medicaid/CHIP-eligible minority children compared children obtaining coverage vs. those remaining uninsured. Subjects were recruited at 97 community sites, and 11 outcomes monitored monthly for 1 year.ResultsIn this sample of 237 children, those obtaining coverage were significantly (P < .05) less likely than the uninsured to have suboptimal health (27% vs. 46%); no PCP (7% vs. 40%); experienced never/sometimes getting immediate care from the PCP (7% vs. 40%); no usual source of preventive (1% vs. 20%) or sick (3% vs. 12%) care; and unmet medical (13% vs. 48%), preventive (6% vs. 50%), and dental (18% vs. 62%) care needs. The uninsured had higher out-of-pocket doctor-visit costs (mean = $70 vs. $29), and proportions of parents not recommending the child’s healthcare provider to friends (24% vs. 8%) and reporting the child’s health caused family financial problems (29% vs. 5%), and lower well-child-care-visit quality ratings. In bivariate analyses, older age, birth outside of the US, and lacking health insurance for >6 months at baseline were associated with remaining uninsured for the entire year. In multivariable analysis, children who had been uninsured for >6 months at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–10.3) and African-American children (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.3) had significantly higher odds of remaining uninsured for the entire year. Insurance saved $2886/insured child/year, with mean healthcare costs = $5155/uninsured vs. $2269/insured child (P = .04).ConclusionsProviding health insurance to Medicaid/CHIP-eligible uninsured children improves health, healthcare access and quality, and parental satisfaction; reduces unmet needs and out-of-pocket costs; and saves $2886/insured child/year. African-American children and those who have been uninsured for >6 months are at greatest risk for remaining uninsured. Extrapolation of the savings realized by insuring uninsured, Medicaid/CHIP-eligible children suggests that America potentially could save $8.7–$10.1 billion annually by providing health insurance to all Medicaid/CHIP-eligible uninsured children.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, provides in-kind benefits that can generally be utilized for Food At Home (FAH) only. According to economic theory, SNAP benefits are fungible with cash for inframarginal households which may allow participants to spend benefits on non-FAH items. However, empirical evidence for this theory is mixed. This paper exploits an underutilized source of state-level variation, the early-2000 s recession, to determine the impact of SNAP participation on household Food Away From Home (FAFH) consumption. In a difference in difference framework, I compare households in high post-recession SNAP growth states to households in low post-recession SNAP growth states. The results show that SNAP participation causes a significant decrease in FAFH expenditure and FAFH’s share of total food expenditure.",

        "abstract": "Although many adults and children are resilient after divorce, it is common for marital breakups to precipitate the need for government assistance for families who had been self-sufficient. This study focuses on the economic costs of divorce associated with means-tested welfare programs in Texas, which fall into five central areas: medical assistance; cash assistance; food assistance; housing, energy, and utility assistance; and child care and development assistance. The study estimated that Texas spends at least $3.18 billion on divorce and its related consequences each year, accounting for approximately 12% of the total Texas budget in 2008. These results reinforce the notion that family actions often have public consequences. Policy implications related to services aimed at strengthening healthy marriage and decreasing “preventable” divorce via reconciliation services are offered.",

Although these children may be at risk for health disparities relating to socioeconomic disadvantage and cultural or linguistic challenges, immigrant families have unique strengths and potential for resilience. Adaptive and acculturation processes concerning health and well-being can be mediated by cultural media. Pediatricians have a professional responsibility to address the medical, mental health, and social needs of immigrant families. Advocacy and research at the practice level and beyond can further explore the unique needs of this population and evidence-based strategies for health promotion.",

        "abstract": "Low-income households contend with high energy costs and poor thermal comfort due to poor structural conditions and energy inefficiencies in their homes. Energy efficiency upgrades can potentially reduce energy expenses and improve thermal comfort, while also addressing problematic issues in the home environment. The present mixed method pilot study explored the impacts of energy efficiency upgrades in 20 households in a low-income community in New York City. Surveys and interviews were administered to the heads of household in a variety of housing types. Interviews were also conducted with landlords of buildings that had recently undergone upgrades. Findings indicate that energy efficiency measures resulted in improved thermal comfort, enhanced health and safety and reduced energy costs. Participants reported largely positive experiences with the upgrades, resulting in direct and indirect benefits. However, results also indicate negative consequences associated with the upgrades and further illustrate that weatherization alone was insufficient to address all of the issues facing low-income households. Moreover, qualitative results revealed differing experiences of low-income renters compared to homeowners. Overall, energy efficiency upgrades are a promising intervention to mitigate the energy and structurally related challenges facing low-income households, but larger scale research is needed to capture the long-term implications of these upgrades.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThe earned income tax credit (EITC), refundable monies for America's working poor, is associated with improved child health. Yet, 20% of eligible families do not receive it. We provided free tax preparation services in clinics serving low-income families and assessed use, financial impact, and accuracy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFree tax preparation services (\"StreetCred\") were available at 4 clinics in Boston in 2016 and 2017. We surveyed a convenience sample of clients (n = 244) about experiences with StreetCred and previous tax services and of nonparticipants (n = 100; 69% response rate) and clinic staff (n = 41; 48% response rate) about acceptability and feasibility.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 753 clients received $1 619 650 in federal tax refunds. StreetCred was associated with significant improvement in tax filing rates. Of surveyed clients, 21% were new filers, 47% were new users of free tax preparation, 14% reported new receipt of the EITC, and 21% reported new knowledge of the EITC. StreetCred had high client acceptability; 96% would use StreetCred again. Families with children were significantly more likely to report StreetCred made them feel more connected to their doctor (P = .02). Clinic staff viewed the program favorably (97% approval).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFree tax services in urban clinics are a promising, feasible financial intervention to increase tax filing and refunds, save fees, and link clients to the EITC. With future studies, we will assess scalability and measure impact on health. StreetCred offers an innovative approach to improving child health in primary care settings through a financial intervention.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive analysis of the 2009 Current Population Survey–Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) provides the first snapshot of the involvement of people with disabilities in a broad array of government programs. Focusing on the working-age population, this analysis reveals that people with disabilities represent one third of the persons who participate in safety-net programs. Among persons with disabilities, 65% participate in a safety-net program, compared with 17% of persons without disabilities. Among Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries, 38% participate in safety-net programs other than DI, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, and Medicare. Furthermore, results suggest that only 3% and 8% of low-income nonworking safety-net participants with and without disabilities, respectively, utilize employment services. Improved data collection on the use of employment services is needed to further evaluate the interaction of safety-net and employment services programs.",

Peter Germanis, now writing as “Peter the Citizen,” reached out to indicate that he now directs his attention to TANF, and has not considered Social Security for many years. The resulting communication clearly demonstrates that thoughtful conservatives can set aside ideological considerations and collaborate with those of differing views without sacrificing their basic principles. Despite claims of success, TANF has failed to achieve its goals, and has had disastrous results. His analyses are insightful, and should serve as the basis for reform of “welfare reform.” What should be rejected soundly is any use of TANF as a model for revision of policy.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nStudies have found considerable heterogeneity in the links between employment and mental health, finding that certain work conditions, such as nonstandard schedules and low job quality, are linked with poorer mental health. One largely overlooked facet of work is multiple job holding. In this article, we examine the link between multiple job holding and mental health among low-income mothers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 7,844 person-wave observations), a longitudinal cohort study (1999-2016) of mostly low-income mothers in 20 large U.S. cities, to examine the link between multiple job holding and maternal depression and life dissatisfaction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAcross a number of different model specifications, we find that multiple job holding is associated with higher probabilities of depression (3-4 percentage points higher). We also find some weaker evidence that multiple job holding is associated with life dissatisfaction (2-4 percentage points higher). When we include measures of job quality and intensity, we continue to see an independent association between multiple job holding and mental health. We also find that the associations between multiple job holding and depression/life dissatisfaction are strongest for mothers who also work 45 hours or more per week, work nonstandard schedules, and have lower earnings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that multiple job holding is associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing depression and somewhat associated with greater life dissatisfaction and should be considered by mental health practitioners and researchers seeking to understand drivers of depression.",

Compared to households that do not include a person with a disability or veteran, disabled nonveteran households are more likely to be in poverty and to experience home hardship, medical hardship, and bill-paying hardship. Disabled veteran households are not significantly different in terms of poverty, but exhibit the highest odds of home hardship, medical hardship, bill-paying hardship, and food insufficiency.

        "abstract": "With an estimated 12.1% of children aged 2-5 years already obese, prevention efforts must target our youngest children. One of the best places to reach young children for such efforts is the early care and education setting (ECE). More than 11 million U.S. children spend an average of 30 hours per week in ECE facilities. Increased attention at the national, state, and community level on the ECE setting for early obesity prevention efforts has sparked a range of innovative efforts. To assist these efforts, CDC developed a technical assistance and training framework - the Spectrum of Opportunities for Obesity Prevention in the ECE setting - which also served as the organizing framework for the Weight of the Nation ECE track. Participants highlighted their efforts at national, state, and local levels pursuing opportunities on the Spectrum, the standards and best practices that had been the emphasis of their efforts, and common steps for developing, implementing, and evaluating initiatives. Strong leadership and collaboration among a broad group of stakeholders; systematic assessment of needs, opportunities and resources; funding sources; and training and professional development were reported to be integral for successful implementation of standards and best practices, and sustainability.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore parental attitudes and perceptions about the school breakfast program in a state with low school breakfast participation. Design: A cross‐sectional study design that used an online survey completed by parents supplemented with district data from a state department of education. The survey included quantitative and qualitative components. Setting: A rural Midwestern state with low school breakfast participation. Participants: Parents and caregivers of children in grades 1–12 were recruited through schools to complete a survey (n = 7,209). Main Outcome Measures: Participation in a school breakfast program. Analysis: A generalized estimating equation model was used to analyze the data and account for the possible correlation among students from the same school district. Open‐end survey items were coded. Results: Parents identified several structural and logistic barriers in response to open‐ended survey items. Factors associated with breakfast participation include perceived benefits, stigma related to those for whom breakfast is intended, and the importance of breakfast. Conclusions and Implications: Interventions should be designed to test whether changing parent perceptions and decreasing stigma will lead to increased breakfast participation. Policy, systems, and environment changes addressing the structural and logistic barriers also may have the potential to increase participation.",

        "abstract": "We examine households’ applications to and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program using administrative records from South Carolina. We model application resolutions with multinomial logit (MNL) specifications where the possible outcomes are acceptance, denial due to income ineligibility, denial due to a failure to provide sufficient information and denial due to other reasons. For cases with successful applications, we model the durations of participation spells using competing risk hazard specifications that distinguish among exits that result from missed recertifications, financial ineligibility, incomplete or missing information and other reasons. The application and hazard outcomes depend on past programme behaviour and observed characteristics. The results indicate that a household’s application and participation history affect its subsequent application success and programme tenure.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To test the reliability and validity of the Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument (NLit) in adult primary care and identify the relationship between nutrition literacy and diet quality. Design: This instrument validation study included a cross‐sectional sample participating in up to 2 visits 1 month apart. Setting/Participants: A total of 429 adults with nutrition‐related chronic disease were recruited from clinics and a patient registry affiliated with a Midwestern university medical center. Main Outcome Measures: Nutrition literacy was measured by the NLit, which was composed of 6 subscales: nutrition and health, energy sources in food, food label and numeracy, household food measurement, food groups, and consumer skills. Diet quality was measured by Healthy Eating Index–2010 with nutrient data from Diet History Questionnaire II surveys. Analysis: The researchers measured factor validity and reliability by using binary confirmatory factor analysis; test‐retest reliability was measured by Pearson r and the intraclass correlation coefficient, and relationships between nutrition literacy and diet quality were analyzed by linear regression. Results: The NLit demonstrated substantial factor validity and reliability (0.97; confidence interval, 0.96–0.98) and test‐retest reliability (0.88; confidence interval, 0.85–0.90). Nutrition literacy was the most significant predictor of diet quality (&bgr; = .17; multivariate coefficient = 0.10; P < .001). Conclusions: The NLit is a valid and reliable tool for measuring nutrition literacy in adult primary care patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPrior health services research (HSR) agendas for children have been published, but major ones are now over 15 years old and do not reflect augmented understanding of the drivers and determinants of children's health; recent changes in the organization, financing, and delivery of health care; a growing emphasis on population health; and major demographic shifts in the population. A policy-relevant research agenda that integrates knowledge gained over the past 2 decades is essential to guide future child HSR (CHSR). We sought to develop and disseminate a robust, domestically focused, policy-oriented CHSR agenda.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe new CHSR agenda was developed through a series of consultations with leaders in CHSR and related fields. After each round of consultation, the authors synthesized the previous experts' guidance to help inform subsequent discussions. The multistep process in generation of the agenda included identification of major policy-relevant research domains and specification of high-value research questions for each domain. Stakeholders represented in the discussions included those with expertise in child and family advocacy, adult health, population health, community development, racial and ethnic disparities, women's health, health economics, and government research funders and programs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 180 individuals were consulted in developing the research agenda. Six priority domains were identified for future research, including both enduring and emerging emphases: 1) framing children's health issues so that they are compelling to policy-makers; 2) addressing poverty and other social determinants of child health and wellbeing; 3) promoting equity in population health and health care; 4) preventing, diagnosing, and treating high priority health conditions in children; 5) strengthening performance of the health care system; and 6) enhancing the CHSR enterprise. Within these 6 domains, 40 specific topics were identified as the most pertinent for future research. Three overarching and crosscutting themes that affect research across the domains were also noted: the need for syntheses to build on the current, and sometimes extensive, evidence base to avoid duplication; the interrelated nature of the domains, which could lead to synergies in research; and the need for multidisciplinary collaborations in conducting research because research studies will look beyond the health sector.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe priorities presented in the agenda are policy-oriented and include a greater emphasis on how findings are framed and communicated to support action. We expect that the agenda will be useful for immediate uptake by investigators and research funders.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to provide a descriptive case study of a dollar-for-dollar match program at farmers’ markets for families using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Specifically, the study sought to examine characteristics (e.g., demographics, household food security), needs, and benefits of families using the match program. It also sought to examine recommendations from families in order to improve the match program. Participants included 143 parents and caregivers of children from ages 5–10, who received services through the weekly match program at markets designed for individuals receiving SNAP benefits. While shopping at farmers’ markets, parents completed questionnaires regarding several domains including service usage, shopping habits, food consumption patterns, and household food security. Parents reported that they strongly agreed that fruits and vegetables were important to their health. However, only 35.9% of parents indicated that they strongly agreed that they could afford to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. Overall, parents reported a positive impact of service use and appeared to value fresh fruits and vegetables. Implications for policy development as well as recommendations for future studies focusing on health promotion in children and families are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The effects of health insurance on poverty have been difficult to ascertain because US poverty measures have not taken into account the need for health care and the value of health benefits. We developed the first US poverty measure to include the need for health insurance and to count health insurance benefits as resources available to meet that need-in other words, a health-inclusive poverty measure. We estimated the direct effects of health insurance benefits on health-inclusive poverty for people younger than age sixty-five, comparing the impacts of different health insurance programs and of nonhealth means-tested cash and in-kind benefits, refundable tax credits, and nonhealth social insurance programs. Private health insurance benefits reduced poverty by 3.7 percentage points. Public health insurance benefits (from Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable Care Act premium subsidies) accounted for nearly one-third of the overall poverty reduction from public benefits. Poor adults with neither children nor a disability experienced little poverty relief from public programs, and what relief they did receive came mostly from premium subsidies and other public health insurance benefits. Medicaid had a larger effect on child poverty than all nonhealth means-tested benefits combined.",

        "abstract": "A view that gained momentum in the 1990s, and which is sustained by some policy analysts and labor economists today, is that dependence on public assistance is greater for immigrants than for natives. Accordingly, this study investigates nativity differentials in the use of nine assistance programs, focusing on immigrant arrival cohorts within three distinct mode-of-entry proxy categories. The logistic regression analysis uses data from the 2013 CPS March supplement. To permit more nuanced interpretation, control variables are introduced hierarchically in a three-stage analysis. One new finding is that each of the three major regional-origin groups within the 1980-1995 refugee cohort-with an average length of residence exceeding two decades-sustains greater use of either SSI or Medicaid than natives. The study concludes that nativity differences in the use of public assistance continue to rest on the socio-demographic composition of three distinct populations, determined by mode of entry into the U.S.",

        "abstract": "The remarkable transformation of the American social safety net that began in the early 1990s has led to seismic shifts in who benefits and how. More than two decades later, how should these changes be judged? Expanding and updating prior influential reviews, we evaluate how the transformation of the safety net—broadly defined—has shaped economic and family dynamics within low-income households. Collectively, social safety net policies have expanded support for working poor parents quite dramatically, while the cash safety net for the nonworking poor has all but collapsed. Working poor families have come out ahead economically, with mounting evidence of positive long-term benefits for child health and development. At the same time, a substantial number of poor families have fallen through the cracks, disconnected from stable, adequate wage income and cash aid. A growing number report income so low that it can be tracked with indicators used to measure poverty in the developing world. Meanwhile, contrary t...",

        "abstract": "To identify student- and school-level sociodemographic characteristics associated with overweight and obesity, the authors conducted cross-sectional analyses of data from 624,204 public school children (kindergarten through 12th grade) who took part in the 2007-2008 New York City Fitnessgram Program. The overall prevalence of obesity was 20.3%, and the prevalence of overweight was 17.6%. In multivariate models, the odds of being obese as compared with normal weight were higher for boys versus girls (odds ratio (OR) = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.36, 1.42), for black (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.15) and Hispanic (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.43, 1.53) children as compared with white children, for children receiving reduced-price (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.21) or free (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.15) school lunches as compared with those paying full price, and for US-born students (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.50, 1.58) as compared with foreign-born students. After adjustment for individual-level factors, obesity was associated with the percentage of students who were US-born (across interquartile range (75th percentile vs. 25th), OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.14) and the percentage of students who received free or reduced-price lunches (across interquartile range, OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.18). The authors conclude that individual sociodemographic characteristics and school-level sociodemographic composition are associated with obesity among New York City public school students.",

        "abstract": "The household income data used most frequently to estimate poverty rates in the United States substantially underreports the value of means-tested transfers. This paper investigates how underreporting affects estimates of the incidence and composition of poverty in the U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Specifically, I apply benefit adjustments for the underreporting of three social transfers to the Current Population Survey (CPS ASEC) to provide more accurate estimates of poverty rates. Diagnostic checks indicate that the imputed benefit adjustments are imperfect, but do provide a more accurate representation of household income than the uncorrected CPS data. In 2015, the benefit adjustments add more than $30 billion of income transfers to the CPS ASEC, primarily concentrated among low-income households with children. I test the effects of the benefit corrections on two conceptualizations of poverty: the U.S. Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) and a relative measure of poverty set at 50% of federal median income. In 2015, the SPM poverty rate for the total population falls from 14.3 to 12.7%, a 1.6 percentage point (11%) decline, after adjusting for underreporting. Among children, the SPM poverty rate falls from 16.1 to 12.8%, a 3.3 percentage point (20%) decline. The percent-of-median poverty rate experiences similar declines after applying the benefit imputations. The findings suggest that the uncorrected CPS data meaningfully overestimates the incidence of poverty in the U.S., particularly among households with children. Documentation for applying the benefit adjustments to the CPS is provided for improved estimates in future poverty research.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTParticipation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has increased over the past decade. Although poverty and sudden financial shock faced by households via unanticipated adverse events, such as sudden loss of income, are among major contributors, the findings of our study suggest that having an adequate stock of savings and financial assets might reduce the probability of household SNAP participation. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we tested whether a household’s emergency savings, asset poverty, and debt burden could predict SNAP participation separately from the effects of income and program participation. Results demonstrate that a household’s lack of emergency savings and asset inadequacy increased the probability of its SNAP participation. Implications for financial practitioners and policy makers are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Residents of poor and minority neighborhoods have less access to healthy, affordable food than their counterparts in more advantaged neighborhoods, and these disparities translate into population-level health disparities by race and socioeconomic status. Current research debates the extent of these disparities and how they translate into unequal health outcomes, but it has paid less attention to the micro-level decision-making processes and strategies residents employ to access food in the context of constrained personal and neighborhood resources. We examined this gap in the literature using data from in-depth qualitative interviews with 66 poor residents of three urban neighborhoods with varying nutritional environments. We found that economic and geographic constraints strongly influenced where and how residents shopped, but within those constraints, residents developed a number of adaptive strategies to maximize the quality and variety of their groceries. We also found that higher-quality stores and purchases were important to residents not only for their material benefits—such as health and cost—but also for their symbolic value. The presence of many stores, close stores, and high-quality stores offered opportunities for symbolic consumption and boosted neighborhood reputations but also created settings for social exclusion. These results illuminate how inequalities in nutritional environments shape residents’ lived experiences and highlight residents’ agency and resourcefulness in responding to such constraints.",

In this study, we examine how the receipt of public and private food assistance is associated with regular family routines, using longitudinal data on low-income families with children from the Three City Study. Estimates from fixed-effects regression models indicate that WIC participation is positively associated with homework routines and consistent bed times. However, receipt of other assistance is not strongly associated with family routines.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the incidence and reverse of obesity among young low-income children and variations across population subgroups.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included 1.2 million participants in federally funded child health and nutrition programs who were 0 to 23 months old in 2008 and were followed up 24 to 35 months later in 2010-2011. Weight and height were measured. Obesity at baseline was defined as gender-specific weight-for-length ≥95th percentile on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Obesity at follow-up was defined as gender-specific BMI-for-age ≥95th percentile. We used a multivariable log-binomial model to estimate relative risk of obesity adjusting for gender, baseline age, race/ethnicity, duration of follow-up, and baseline weight-for-length percentile.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of obesity was 11.0% after the follow-up period. The incidence was significantly higher among boys versus girls and higher among children aged 0 to 11 months at baseline versus those older. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, the risk of obesity was 35% higher among Hispanics and 49% higher among American Indians (AIs)/Alaska Natives (ANs), but 8% lower among non-Hispanic African Americans. Among children who were obese at baseline, 36.5% remained obese and 63.5% were nonobese at follow-up. The proportion of reversing of obesity was significantly lower among Hispanics and AIs/ANs than that among other racial/ethnic groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe high incidence underscores the importance of early-life obesity prevention in multiple settings for low-income children and their families. The variations within population subgroups suggest that culturally appropriate intervention efforts should be focused on Hispanics and AIs/ANs.",

Mean consumption was 1.5 cups in the past 3 days. Intentions to buy (r = 0.20, P < .001) and eat (r = 0.23, P < .001) DGLV were positively associated with consumption. Reasoned Action Approach constructs explained 71.2% of the variance in intention to buy, and 60.9% of the variance in intention to eat DGLV. Attitude (β = .63) and self-efficacy (β = .24) related to buying and attitude (β = .60) and self-efficacy (β = .23) related to eating DGLV explained significant amounts of variance in intentions to buy and eat more DGLV. Perceived norm was unrelated to either intention to buy or eat DGLV.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nInterventions designed for this population of women should aim to improve DGLV-related attitudes and self-efficacy.",

        "abstract": "A large body of evidence indicates that conditions in-utero and health at birth matter for individuals' long-run outcomes, suggesting potential value in programs aimed at pregnant women and young children. This paper uses a novel identification strategy and data from birth and administrative records over 2005-2009 to provide causal estimates of the effects of geographic access to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). My empirical approach uses within-ZIP-code variation in WIC clinic presence together with maternal fixed effects, and accounts for the potential endogeneity of mobility, gestational-age bias, and measurement error in gestation. I find that access to WIC increases food benefit take-up, pregnancy weight gain, birth weight, and the probability of breastfeeding initiation at the time of hospital discharge. The estimated effects are strongest for mothers with a high school education or less, who are most likely eligible for WIC services.",

Caregivers face a number of physical and socioeconomic challenges and their access to services to address these problems is limited. Many states and social service agencies are exploring and struggling with policies and approaches to serve kinship families, especially those uninvolved with formal child welfare systems. This article describes the outcome of a study completed on behalf of a public welfare serving agency in a small southern state charged with determining how to best serve kinship families, given the State's existing resources and congruent with best-practice models. The final recommendation to the State resulted in a three-phase program with a 5-year implementation strategy. Benefits to this discussion include an illumination of the process and critical factors to explore for program and polic...",

        "abstract": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest federal nutrition assistance program. Undocumented noncitizens are ineligible to receive SNAP benefits, but their children under age 18 or other qualified noncitizen family members may be eligible. Due to the recent economic recession as well as anti-immigrant legislation and sentiment in Arizona, it is possible that eligible low-income Hispanics are not participating in programs like SNAP that would alleviate hunger and food security. A self-administered survey on nutrition assistance program participation, demographics, food security, and acculturation was completed by a convenience sample of 352 women aged 18–65 years in metro Phoenix, Arizona. Fifty-one percent of participants were food secure. Significant differences in degree of food insecurity by acculturation status existed with 8% of Hispanic dominant women having “very low food security” in contrast to 19% of English dominant women (P = .003). Fifty percent received SNAP benefit...",

In general, the programs respond as we would expect based on the program laws and regulations, with some important exceptions, including that benefits received under some programs take much longer to fully adjust to earned-income increases than we would expect. We explore the reasons for these departures from our expectations and discuss the implications for policymakers’ efforts to balance the programs’ goals of poverty alleviation, cost effectiveness, and work promotion.",

The focus of the policy report is on formal psychosocial services. CWS plans prescribe services to promote core child welfare objectives and to benefit children and families. The goal of EBSP is to construct service plans based on the general principles of evidence-based practice and prefer services with empirical support for clinical problems or needs associated with the causes or consequences of child abuse and neglect (CAN). EBSP aims to facilitate an overarching service approach that is collaborative, respectful, and includes services that are most likely to lead to outcomes on both family identified and child welfare mission goals. EBSP emphasizes a focused, assessment-driven, and science-informed approach that both favors plans that are sufficient and avoids overburdening families with compulsory services that address problems which are not directly related to the child welfare CAN referral.",

        "abstract": "An increasing number of people no longer enrolled in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) experience periods of “disconnection” after exiting the welfare program. The present research, based on data from a large longitudinal state welfare leaver study, explores the circumstances and characteristics of welfare leavers who receive no formal employment earnings but do not return to cash assistance for at least 1 year after exiting welfare. Using a variety of administrative program data and welfare caseworker notes, the size of the various subgroups within the disconnected population and their possible needs were examined. Cluster analysis revealed 6 important subgroups with differing needs and barriers. The findings focus on policy implications, particularly in relation to the Congressional reauthorization of TANF.",

        "abstract": "Objectives It is unknown if the explosion in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) usage during the Great Recession was due to an inflow of new participants or instead because former participants cycled back into the program. It is also unknown if the profiles of new and return participants differed on a set of core demographic characteristics, including race/ethnicity, gender, education, age, household configuration, and location. Methods I examine the complete adult SNAP participation histories for a nationally representative crossâ€ section of 7,680 individuals at the end of the Great Recession. Data are from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with observations spanning the period 1968â€“2010. Results A large number of adult SNAP participants used the program for the first time during the Great Recession. New participants were not solely young adults and often originated from groups not typically associated with social program participation, such as: whites, suburbanites, and the highly educated. Repeat participants had varying program histories prior to the recession. Some spent a substantial portion of adulthood receiving program benefits while most others were only sporadic participants. Conclusions The findings demonstrate that SNAP was very successful in reaching the many new types of people who were exposed to the risk of poverty as a result of the economic downturn.",

Researchers can use administrative records in conjunction with survey data to better measure family relationships and to capture the experiences of individuals and family members across multiple points in time and social and economic domains. Administrative data can be used to evaluate program participation in government social welfare programs, as well as to evaluate the accuracy of reporting on receipt of such benefits. Administrative records can also be used to enhance collection and accuracy of survey and census data and to improve coverage of hard-to-reach populations. This article discusses potential uses of linked administrative and survey data, gives an overview of the linking methodology and infrastructure (including limitations), and reviews social science literature that has used this method to date.",

We analyze data from the Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement to find reasons for this seeming anomaly. Analysis of a 2-year panel sample of households interviewed in 2 successive years found different conditions in 2 distinct groups. One third of households that left SNAP in one year returned in the following year and were more likely to have had very low food security in both years. Households that left SNAP in 1 year and remained off through the following year were also more likely than current recipients to have had very low food security in the first year, but by the end of the following year, the prevalence of very low food security was lower than among those still on the program. Logistic regression analysis indicates that, for households with very low food security, leaving SNAP was strongly associated with higher income a...",

Three surveys collected F&V intake for mother and child and nutrition knowledge/competencies. FMNP groups were compared on main outcomes using bivariate analyses and logistic regression.Results: Among participants using all coupons upon issuance, F&V intake significantly increased across surveys. In addition, intake significantly increased among >50% of FMNP participants reporting learned competencies (P = .03).Conclusions: WIC FMNP may be more effective with requirement to use all FMNP coupons upon issuance. F&V intakes may increase with nutrition education on competencies.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the major themes associated with young disadvantaged men, including low educational achievement, joblessness, out-of-wedlock childbearing, and incarceration. By age 30, between 68 percent and 75 percent of young men with a high school degree or less are fathers (NLSY). Half of them are married when their first child is born and far fewer continue their education post-high school. The paper briefly reviews four major forces that help shape social and economic outcomes for young men who are fathers and for their partners and children: employment and earnings prospects; multiple-partner fertility; incarceration; and finally public policy, especially as it is reflected in the income support system and the child support system. The paper provides brief synopses of volume chapters to appear in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science in 2011. It ends with an exploration of policy solutions to the many challenges facing young disadvantaged men.",

        "abstract": "We provide evidence for the causal relationship between unemployment insurance (UI) and individuals' smoking behavior using the 1995-2011 Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement data. Our identification relies on the exploitation of the exogenous variations of the maximum UI weekly benefits across states and over years. Instead of focusing on all unemployed people, we concentrate on those who are eligible for UI benefits. We find that when the maximum UI weekly benefit level increases by $100, smoking cessation increases by approximately 2.9 percentage points among the UI-eligible unemployed. The results are robust to various model specifications. We also explore the mechanism and find suggestive evidence that the increase in the maximum UI weekly benefit leads to a decrease in the probability of over-work of the respective spouse. Moreover, the unemployed who are less educated are more responsive to the increasing UI benefits.",

        "abstract": "Puritan work ethics proved alive and well when economist James M. Buchanan, a Nobel Memorial Prize winner, alleged in 1994 that work is an ethical principle, not a personal or structural economic one. Buchanan contended that a person who avoids work, and the taxable income that could be earned by it, places greater obligations on others, for which that person carries a moral liability. When people work, according to Buchanan, they benefit others as well as themselves, while a “non-Puritan set of moral norms or constraints … may be unproductive and may actually reduce value in the economy” making everyone worse off as a result.1 Idleness, according to Buchanan is morally wrong, because even the slightest amount of work brings a benefit to all. Buchanan’s assertions simply buttressed growing consensus among conservative politicians who believed work was “redemptive” and “would rescue welfare recipients from the companions of sloth, including booze, idleness, illicit sex and hanging out.”2",

However, the increase in SNAP enrollment does not lead to greater food spending or a reduction in food insecurity except for households with children.",

Analyses of the demographic, employment, economic, and skill-building characteristics of ABAWDS reveal that poor ABAWDs struggle with low rates of program receipt and continuous employment as well as low levels of education in addition to other persistent disadvantages. Results suggest that this group has specific needs that can be addressed by social policies aimed at improving access to education, skill-building training, and long-term employment.",

        "abstract": "During the recent Great Recession, US households, especially those with low incomes, faced severe financial distress. Households experiencing economic hardship may turn to receiving government assistance to alleviate the hardship or distress. Receiving government assistance may improve a household’s financial situation as it could be decreasing its reliance on debt or even improving a household’s ability to repay their current debt. We investigated how households’ financial debt obligations were affected by receiving government assistance, as has not been previously analyzed. Given the focus of this research, we included households under 185 % of poverty threshold released by the 2012 US Census Bureau. Results from the 2010 and 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that government assistance was positively related to the odds of meeting debt-to-income ratio guidelines, implying that government assistance plays an important role in financial security of low-income households. This study provides important insights for researchers and policymakers in the areas of poverty and household finance.",

        "abstract": "Beginning in 2001, states were given the authority to formulate their own rules on how vehicles are counted toward the asset limit in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. We exploit differences in timing of the state vehicle asset policy changes toidentify their effect on vehicle assets and debts, car ownership, liquid assets holdings, as well as non-housing wealth.We estimate difference-in-differences and household fixed effects specifications and find that liberalizing vehicle asset rules increases vehicle assets of households with a high ex ante probability of program participation. Households also take on more debt to finance their vehicles.The increase in car value can be attributed primarily to less educated single parents who already owned a car before the policy change buying more expensive cars.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the expenditure response to the largest increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, instituted in April 2009. Investigating the effects in both food and non-food spending categories, I find that the rise in SNAP benefits increased not only food at home expenditures, but also housing, transportation, and education expenditures of SNAP households relative to those of non-SNAP households. Specifically, the SNAP benefit increase leads to the reduced out-of-pocket spending on food for infra-marginal SNAP recipients, and the freed up resources allowed households with bounded budgets to fund other essential needs, such as paying mortgage, rent, utility fee, transportation expenses as well as tuition. Examining non-food expenditures provides a more complete picture of the impact of the SNAP benefit increase by shedding light on the spillover effect of the policy change. The result also derives policy implication on ongoing debate about SNAP allotment generosity.",

        "abstract": "type=\"main\"> We examine how low-income households have drawn upon public and charitable nonprofit sources of social assistance during and after the Great Recession. Using panel survey data collected in the Detroit Metropolitan Area in 2008 and 2010, we explore the relationships between household characteristics, program use, and bundling of assistance. Roughly two-thirds of Detroit households within 300 percent of poverty received a public safety net benefit in the previous year; about 40 percent received assistance from more than one public program. More than one in six households received help from a nonprofit charity. Low educational attainment, unemployment, and health limitations are positively related to receipt of multiple public assistance programs. Our findings point to persistent needs among poor and near-poor households after the Great Recession, as well as to the reality that many low-income households draw upon multiple sources of public assistance even when working. Many low-income households remain detached from public and charitable sources of support even as the safety net has expanded in response to the downturn.",

It also is a topic that pediatricians must become cognizant of because of the impact it has on the children we care for daily. It goes beyond the specific income threshold that sets the federal poverty level; rather it impacts on the ability of families to acquire life's basic needs to allow their children the opportunity to reach their full potential. These basic needs include adequate nutrition to grow and develop in an optimal fashion and a secure and stable home in a safe neighborhood, which allows for play, exploration, and physical activity. It must also include access to health insurance coverage as well as a physician, health center, and health system to meet their medical needs. In addition, we must provide early education opportunities to nurture the social and emotional health of our children and prepare each child for school. The school environment must promote academic achievement and the broader community must foster opportunities to minimize violence and reduce the need for incarceration. The integration of such provisions represents a broadening and redefinition of the Social Safety Net that incorporates both public and private sector efforts to maximize the life potential of each child.",

        "abstract": "Interventions that cultivate sustainable food systems to promote health, prevent obesity, and improve food security have the potential for many large-scale and long-lasting benefits including improvements in social, environmental, health, and economic outcomes. We briefly summarize findings from previous research examining associations between obesity and food insecurity and discuss the need for greater synergy between food insecurity initiatives and national obesity prevention public health goals in the United States. The common ground between these two nutrition-related public health issues is explored, and the transformation needed in research and advocacy communities around the shared goal of improving population health through individual, environmental, and policy level changes to promote healthy sustainable food systems is discussed. We propose an ecological framework to simultaneously consider food insecurity and obesity that identifies levers for change to promote sustainable food systems to improve food security and prevent obesity.",

        "abstract": "USDA uses the concept of \"publish-ability\" rather than statistical reliability of an estimate for quality validation of USDA estimates, which is solely based on the sample size and the coefficient of variation (CV). We demonstrate conceptually how the reliability of the sample mean can be tested by estimating the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval for an unknown population mean using the CV. However, the reliability test for the sample mean can be made only under the normality assumption. USDA multiple-way Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) estimates are used to illustrate the relative measure of precision for sample-based estimators.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in cooperative theory have focused on membership heterogeneity as being a significant challenge for cooperative sustainability. We use predictive analytics to forecast U.S. farmer cooperative sustainability at an aggregate level and include multiple dimensions of membership heterogeneity. We report the importance and shape of the effect of membership heterogeneity when predicting and forecasting cooperative sustainability in the near-term. We also report forecasts of cooperative sustainability given expected changes to membership heterogeneity. The data this study used are from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Economic Research Service (ERS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) joined with USDA-Rural Development cooperative financial data at the state level. Membership heterogeneity was found to be less relevant than other variables included in the model for predicting cooperative business volume and number of cooperatives headquartered per state, and an estimate of cooperative sustainability. Membership heterogeneity effects were mostly offsetting given expected changes to member heterogeneity, and/or were offset due to changes to other macro factors. Consequently, we conclude membership heterogeneity may affect the number of cooperatives and extent consistent with theoretical literature at a micro level; however, we also expect a similar level of sustainability of cooperatives at an aggregate level in the near-term despite changes to membership heterogeneity.",

However, relatively few farmers have adopted cover crops, so understanding the barriers to adoption is necessary. We used a probit model with data on 1,712 soybean producers from the 2012 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey to identify factors affecting adoption of cover crops. We found that more precipitation was positively correlated with adoption, as was more hired labor. Adoption was also positively correlated with crop diversification and no-till adoption, which may relate to equipment availability.",

        "abstract": "Anthropogenically introduced nitrogen (N) has compromised environmental quality, but it is an essential element for crop production, particularly corn production. Increasing N use efficiency by adopting eco-innovations such as N soil testing, plant tissue testing, and N transformation inhibitors can ameliorate this problem. Data from the 2010 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey of corn producers was used to examine the factors affecting adoption of these practices. Twenty-one percent of the 1840 corn farmers had adopted N soil testing, 3% had adopted plant tissue testing, and 10% had adopted N inhibitors. A multivariate probit regression found significant results for each category of explanatory variable that was examined. Among the findings was the importance of information source for N recommendations. Farmers who did not obtain external recommendations were less likely to adopt all three practices than farmers who received recommendations from a crop consultant. Those who received recommendations from fertilizer dealers were less likely to adopt N soil testing and plant tissue testing. All regions were more likely to adopt N soil testing than the Midwest, and warmer regions were less likely to adopt B transformation inhibitors. Those who adopted conservation tillage were more likely to adopt plant tissue testing and N inhibitors, and those who received conservation payments were more likely to adopt N soil testing and plant tissue testing. Adoption of conservation tillage was also associated with the adoption of several other technologies. Implications for research and educational programs are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have used the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to research various aspects involving the agricultural sector in the United States, including studies focused at the farm level. Since nonresponse and inaccurate reporting may cause significant bias in statistical analysis, research is conducted to estimate the magnitude of response error in the farm debt section of Phase III in ARMS. USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) data on Farm Loan Program (FLP) borrowers with end of year debt are matched with ARMS respondents for years 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007. A multinomial logit model is estimated to identify demographic, structural, and financial characteristics of FSA borrowers who refused to indicate if they had end of year farm debt, or who accurately or inaccurately classified their farm operations as having end of year farm debt on the ARMS. Additionally, estimates of the magnitude of response errors in ARMS for both FSA direct and guaranteed FLPs are estimated. The current study estimates that 12.9 percent of direct FLP respondents and 9.9% of guaranteed FLP respondents indicated “no” to the question on having end of year farm debt when they should have indicated “yes”. Also, those responding “no” are found to have their ARMS total debt outstanding less than their FSA total debt outstanding. Direct FLP operators are more likely to report “no” and, therefore, under-report end of year debt in the ARMS if they had a lower total FSA debt outstanding balance, had a greater value of crop production relative to total production, or had a lower gross cash farm income. Guaranteed FLP operators are more likely to under-report their debt in the ARMS if they had an operating line of credit loan, had a greater share of production from crops, or had a lower gross cash farm income. They are less likely to under-report their debt if they either had some college education, were eligible for socially disadvantaged loans, or were beginning farmer eligible. These results are of keen interest to those using ARMS data and those responsible for collecting ARMS data. The results allow researchers using ARMS data to appraise operator debt status to be better informed about potential data limitations. For example, estimates of the share of farm operations with little or no debt may be overestimated. Also, the results could assist the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service in developing improved imputation techniques to estimate farm debt from the ARMS, especially for those respondents indicating “no” as to having end of year debt in the Farm Debt section of the ARMS.",

Data from the USDA-Agricultural Resource Management Survey were used for the analysis. Computers for managing records were used by most farmers, but adoption rates for the remaining technologies were much lower. Adoption rates differed by demographics, financial status, farm size and adoption of other technologies. Farm profitability differed by adoption status.",

        "abstract": "Corn (Zea mays L.) residue grazing or harvest provides a simple and economical practice to integrate crops and livestock, but limited information is available on how widespread corn residue utilization is practiced by US producers. In 2010, the USDA Economic Research Service surveyed producers from 19 states on corn grain and residue management practices. Total corn residue grazed or harvested was 4.87 million ha. Approximately 4.06 million ha was grazed by 11.7 million livestock (primarily cattle) in 2010. The majority of grazed corn residue occurred in Nebraska (1.91 million ha), Iowa (385,000 ha), South Dakota (361,000 ha), and Kansas (344,000 ha). Average grazing days ranged from 10 to 73 d (mean = 40 d). Corn residue harvests predominantly occurred in the central and northern Corn Belt, with an estimated 2.9 Tg of corn residue harvested across the 19 states. This survey highlights the importance of corn residue for US livestock, particularly in the western Corn Belt. M.R. Schmer and V.L.

        "abstract": "We estimate how much United States farms changed enterprise diversification in response to a marked increase in crop insurance coverage brought about by the 1994 Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act, which substantially increased insurance subsidies. The analysis exploits farm-level panel census data to compare farm-specific changes in enterprise diversification over time. By examining diversification decisions of the same farms over time, we control for time-invariant unobserved individual heterogeneity. We then use pooled cross-sectional data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Resource Management Survey to estimate the relationship between farm diversification and average returns. We find that the insurance subsidies caused a modest increase in enterprise specialisation and production efficiency. Estimated efficiency gains are far less than the subsidies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we employ a classical experiment to determine if welfare reform causes poor women to experience increased levels of clinical anxiety and depression. We organize our analyses around the insights provided by lifestyle change and ecosocial theories of illness. Our data come from the New Jersey Family Development Program (FDP), one of the most highly publicized welfare experiments in the U.S. A sample of 8393 women was randomly assigned into two groups, one which stressed welfare-to-work and the other which offered traditional welfare benefits. These women were followed from 1992 through 1996 and information on clinical diagnoses was collected quarterly from physician treatment claims to the government Medicaid program. Our intention-to-treat estimates show that for short-term welfare recipients FDP decreased the prevalence of anxiety by 40% and increased depression by 8%. For black women both anxiety and depression diagnoses declined while Hispanic women experienced a 68% increase in depression. We discuss several public policy implications which arise from our work.",

Controlling for selective participation, we find that each year of participation in LFA increases the probability of employment by about 3 percent. In our earnings analyses we find that HCI participants earn about $163 less per year of exposure to this strategy.",

Enhanced JOBS exerted an independent effect on fertility of more chronic recipients. (JEL \"I38\") Copyright 2004 Western Economic Association International.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a blended experimental and quasi-experimental research strategy which we believe will help improve the external validity of evaluations of welfare reform and other social policies. We draw upon data from New Jersey’s imposition of a family cap, where welfare benefits instead of increasing remained the same for women who conceive and bear a child while on public assistance. We directly compare estimates of the policy’s effectiveness on the state’s welfare population using (a) a point-in-time sample randomly assigned to experimental and control group conditions; (b) an initial cohort sample similarly assigned; and (c) a before and after policy implementation of the entire welfare caseload. We find that these estimates can differ dramatically, reflecting sensitivity to a time-induced heterogeneity we have labeled the Heraclitus effect. We discuss how multiple estimates of effectiveness can be used to bound expectations of a welfare reform policy impact when population dynamics data are available.",

In this study, we use data from an experiment conducted with 8,400 women from October 1992 to December 1996 to determine which of the proximate determinants (abortion, contraception, or family planning visits) are critical in women's decisions to give birth while on welfare. We use structural equations modeling to trace the total effect of these proximate determinants on births and the indirect effect of family cap, time on welfare, mother's age, and race. Our analysis shows that length of time on welfare, family cap limitations, and mother's race are indicative of distinctive patterns of proximate determinant use.",

        "abstract": "Using an experimental design, this research examines the effect of the nation's first family cap on the births, abortions, and contraception use of over 8,000 women receiving public assistance in New Jersey. The family cap denies additional cash benefits to children conceived while the mother is receiving public assistance. Our research shows that a targeted welfare benefit manipulation does influence fertility behavior; however, the effect is conditioned by race. We find that Black women in the experimental group have a 21% lower birth rate and a 32% higher abortion rate than Black women in the control group. We do not find a birth effect for Hispanic or White women. We discuss the policy implications of the effects of a segmented family cap. Key Words: family cap, fertility, race differences, welfare reform. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 repealed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), provided the structure of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant program, and profoundly changed the government's legal obligation to provide cash assistance to low income adults and their children. A principal goal of TANF is the prevention and reduction of the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies. It is to be achieved through the establishment of state numerical targets, the implementation of a \"bonus to reward decrease in illegitimacy ratio,\" an Abstinence Education Grant Program, and the option for states to employ a family cap policy (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2001). The family cap, which has taken several forms, denies additional cash benefits to those children born 10 or more months after the mother began receiving welfare payments, although these children typically remain eligible for other benefits, including Food Stamps and Medicaid (Harvey, Camasso, & Jagannathan, 2000). Twenty-three states have chosen to include a family cap policy as a component of welfare reform; 15 of these states began the policy under provisions of Section 1115 of the Social Security Act that allowed states to waive specific provisions of the Act and experiment with initiatives that would improve the AFDC program. From 1992 to the passage of PRWORA, 81 waivered experiments were approved by the Bush (I) and Clinton administrations with approval contingent on a plan for evaluating the proposed changes (Harvey et al., 2000). The first acceptance of a family cap waiver was the initiative proposed by New Jersey in early 1992. This policy called for the loss of additional cash benefits of $102/month if the child is the second child born and $64/ month for any higher order births. In this paper we examine the effect of New Jersey's implementation of the nation's first family cap on nonmarital births, abortions, oral contraception use, and contraceptive sterilization of women receiving public assistance. The cap was implemented along with several other waivers that (a) enhanced earnings disregard for households with capped grants; (b) provided a 2-year extension of Medicaid benefits for welfare recipients that exited AFDC for employment; (c) toughened sanctions for failure to participate in the JOBS program; (d) eliminated the loss of cash benefits for children if a mother married; and (e) required women with children age 2 and older to participate in training/education programs. Unlike the family cap, these policies do not target fertility behavior and, when tested, have not been found to influence birth outcomes (Crouse, 1999; Horvath-Rose & Peters, 2001).

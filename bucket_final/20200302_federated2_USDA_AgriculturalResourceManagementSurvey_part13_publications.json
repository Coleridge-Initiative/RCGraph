        "abstract": "Item non response is a pervasive problem in survey data, and a large literature in statistics has developed to address missing data due to item non response. Government statistical agencies regularly impute for missing values in the microdata that they make available to researchers. Unfortunately, while the imputation methods typically used by government statistical agencies may be suitable for the main objectives of the agency—usually, publishing aggregated descriptive statistics—these imputations are usually unsuitable for multivariate analysis of microdata. Using USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), we apply a new imputation method to missing 2008ARMS data on federal government farm commodity payments and off-farm household income items. We find that the choice of imputation method can have a noticeable effect on important economic indicators, even when the rate of missingness is small.",

        "abstract": "Precision agriculture (PA) and its suite of information technologies—such as soil and yield mapping using a global positioning system (GPS), GPS tractor guidance systems, and variable-rate input application—allow farm operators to fine-tune their production practices. Access to detailed, within-field information can decrease input costs and increase yields. USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey shows that these PA technologies were used on roughly 30 to 50 percent of U.S. corn and soybean acres in 2010-12. Previous studies suggest that use of PA is associated with higher profits under certain conditions, but aggregate estimates of these gains have not been available. In this report, a treatment-effects model is developed to estimate factors associated with PA technology adoption rates and the impacts of adoption on profits. Labor and machinery used in production and certain farm characteristics, like farm size, are associated with adoption as well as with two profit measures, net returns and operating profits. The impact of these PA technologies on profits for U.S. corn producers is positive, but small.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In recent decades, agricultural production in the U.S. has continued to shift to large-scale operations, raising concerns about the economic viability of small and midsized farms. To understand whether economies of size provided an incentive for the consolidation of production, the study estimates the total factor productivity (TFP) of five size classes of grain-producing farms in the U.S. Heartland (Corn Belt) region. Using quinquennial Agricultural Census data from 1982 to 2012 the study also compares TFP growth rates across farm sizes to gain insight into whether observed productivity differences are likely to persist. The finding of a strong positive relationship between farm size and TFP suggests that consolidation of production has contributed to recent aggregate productivity growth in the crop sector. The study estimates the extent to which sectoral productivity growth can be attributed to structural change versus other factors including technological change. The study also explores some tradeoffs associated with policies that raise the productivity of small versus large farms.",

Introduction With the globalization and greater market integration that have been occurring in recent years,the rural economy is now more heavily inﬂuenced by farmer-entrepreneurs who are more responsiveto shifts in market demand related to changes in preferences, fads, and fashions [1]. Put differently,farmer-entrepreneurs are more connected to supply chains, integrated in industry, and active in thecreation of new networks compared with more traditional farmers. Thus, it is not surprising thatresearch over the past two decades that discusses the sources of (and policies related to) agriculturalwealth creation provide a number of strategies for developing the rural economy that are each aimedat generating entrepreneurial capacity [2–5], while also acknowledging that each strategy also dependson that entrepreneurial capacity [6–8]. According to a recent study, the farmer-entrepreneurs shaped bythese strategies are more receptive to new technologies and assistance from extension, more attentiveto changes in prices and the availability of credit, and less risk averse [9].Within the modern rural economy described above, relatively little is known abouthow farmer-entrepreneurs’ innovations relate to their industrial partners, such as those inthe food processing sector, and to research and development (R&D). One view holds that,as farmer-entrepreneurs look for more efﬁcient and proﬁtable ways to produce, they are more open toinnovation and the application of the innovation of their partners, such as when farmer-entrepreneursseek greater integration with the food processing sector. These sectors of the economy markedly differ,however, in terms of market structure. Farmers are generally seen as price takers, while the foodprocessing sector tends to be concentrated and non-competitive [10–12]. As such, it may be the casethat increasing integration drives farmer-entrepreneurs to adapt technological innovations from theprocessing sector [13,14]. It may also be the case that agricultural innovation impacts technological",

        "abstract": "Agritourism is an alternative source of farm income. We examine farmersâ€™ participation in agritourism activities to assess the impact of participation on farm household income and return to assets using a large farm-level survey. The results reveal that older, educated, and female operators are more likely to participate in agritourism. However, government subsidies and the population of the county are negatively correlated with agritourism. Of the types of farm operations examined, small-scale farms that involved agritourism generated the greatest household incomes and returns to assets. For operators of small farms, agritourism can boost the economic well-being of farm households.",

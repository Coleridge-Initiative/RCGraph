        "abstract": "Abstract The growth of the firm is often financed through retained earnings. Entrepreneurs look to expand, make new investments, or pay off debt using free cash flows from the business. However, entrepreneurs in farming businesses derive income from enterprises that have variable income, and farm program payments provided by the government helps smooth income and consumption. Using national-farm level data (2008–2013) and free cash modelling approach we study how government commodity support ( decoupled , coupled payments and subsidized crop insurance ) affects the financial status of farm businesses. Additionally, we investigate the impact of government commodity support on farming business and household expenditures. Findings suggest that free cash flows to equity has a significantly negative impact on total farm household expenditures. Further, our results also suggest that the effect of farm program payments, especially decoupled payments, is small. Elasticities on the decoupled Payments and coupled Payments variables are both positive. However, the magnitude of the effect on the former is four times higher than on the latter. Hence, most of the impact of Title I support on total farm household expenditures will likely be via the decoupled Payments channel. Nonetheless, if the goal of commodity support is to reduce the consumption volatility of farm household, our results suggest that these payments have little impact.",

Profitable crop production practices can have unintended consequences on farm natural resources that are difficult to monitor. This article considers if precision agriculture’s (PrecAg) information technologies can influence the rates, and profit implications, of using best management practices (BMPs) to improve on-farm natural resource stewardship. If PrecAg can increase rice yields with better management of inputs, reducing costs, and increasing profits, resource stewardship may also benefit. U.S. national farm-level production data from NASS (USDA), confirm background hypotheses of links between PrecAg use and BMPs. The main objective is then to test these relationships in a single, comprehensive, treatment effects model that accounts for PrecAg use, resource stewardship, and rice-farm costs and profits. Capital investments in equipment and other fixed costs are included as adoption control variables. The sustainable BMP rice pr...",

        "abstract": "In this article, we consider imputation in the USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data, which is a complex, high-dimensional economic dataset. We develop a robust joint model for ARMS data, which requires that variables are transformed using a suitable class of marginal densities (e.g., skew normal family). We assume that the transformed variables may be linked through a Gaussian copula, which enables construction of the joint model via a sequence of conditional linear models. We also discuss the criteria used to select the predictors for each conditional model. For the purpose of developing an imputation method that is conducive to these model assumptions, we propose a regression-based technique that allows for flexibility in the selection of conditional models while providing a valid joint distribution. In this procedure, labeled as iterative sequential regression (ISR), parameter estimates and imputations are obtained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. Finally, we appl...",

        "abstract": "Abstract Conventional life cycle assessment (LCA) compares technological alternatives and chooses the one that has lower environmental impact, making it an approach for assessing relative sustainability. Such an approach largely ignores the role of ecosystem services (ES) and ecological carrying capacity, despite their essential role in sustaining all human activities. Such ignorance may lead to the over-dependence on scarce resources, perverse impacts on ecosystems, and lost opportunities for improvement. The framework of Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES) accounts for the demand and supply of ES at multiple spatial scales and defines metrics for absolute sustainability at both local and serviceshed scales. Applications of TES have been mainly focusing on localized systems. To prevent the shifting of impacts, a life cycle perspective is also needed. The authors have proposed the Techno-Ecological Synergy in Life Cycle Assessment (TES-LCA) framework by modifying each step in conventional LCA to incorporate the role of ecosystem goods and services. On one hand, TES-LCA advocates conventional solutions of impact reduction through technological improvements. On the other hand, it provides additional insights, including discovering novel ecological solutions to push toward absolute environmental sustainability. Thus, TES-LCA can offer a more comprehensive portfolio on sustainability performance evaluation. The substantial benefits of TES-LCA have been demonstrated by an application to urban farms.",

        "abstract": "We estimate the impacts of various types of government payments to U.S. agriculture on different components of farm household consumption. Using 2003 to 2005 data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), we show that marginal rates of consumption differ by consumption category and income source, including different types of farm program payments. The results suggest that farm households treat income from different sources as imperfect substitutes and may reserve income from specific sources for specific types of consumption. Implications for the effects of different types of government payments on the farm household are considered.",

        "abstract": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) is one of the most important elements of the social safety net. Unlike most other safety net programs, SNAP varies little across states and over time, which creates challenges for quasi-experimental evaluation. Notably, SNAP benefits are fixed across 48 states; but local food prices vary, leading to geographic variation in the real value - or purchasing power - of SNAP benefits. In this study, we provide the first estimates that leverage variation in SNAP purchasing power across markets to examine effects of SNAP on child health. We link panel data on regional food prices to National Health Interview Survey data and use a fixed effects framework to estimate the relationship between local purchasing power of SNAP and children's health and health care utilization. We find that lower SNAP purchasing power leads to lower utilization of preventive health care and more days of school missed due to illness. We estimate no effect on parent-reported health status.",

        "abstract": "The estimated 5.8 million Alzheimer's disease patients in the U.S. require an enormous share of national healthcare expenditures. Other nations face similar economic burdens. There have been great efforts, thus far unsuccessful, to discover an effective therapeutic, with 1081 Alzheimer's disease drug trials completed as of May 2019. The pessimism thus engendered has forestalled contingency planning for the potential major economic repercussions of a simple, quick cure. Yet, promising new research spotlighting the possible \"trigger\" role of infectious agents might allow some or all cases of Alzheimer's disease to be halted, reversed, or prevented with an antibiotic or antiviral compound, possibly even one already approved by drug regulators for other uses. The sudden advent of such an unexpected therapy would theoretically have dramatic impacts, both detrimental and beneficial, on the American economy. The damages would include a $414 billion shrinkage of Medicaid, Medicare and other revenues to all six sectors comprising the healthcare provider category. Nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities are projected to suffer the greatest loss of annual revenue: $51 billion and $16 billion, respectively. This would cause the loss of an estimated 654,000 jobs. Facility mortgage and commercial loan repayments could stop. Other adverse consequences would include detrimental effects on reserves for Social Security and pensions, cutbacks in dementia research funding, and reduced donations to Alzheimer's disease advocacy groups. Insurance company reserves for fixed payment annuities already sold could be jeopardized. However, an Alzheimer's disease cure would also create economic beneficiaries. Medicare and Medicaid would save up to a projected $195 billion annually. Life insurance companies and unpaid caregivers would also benefit financially. By identifying the healthcare sectors likely to be detrimentally impacted by a simple, quick Alzheimer's disease cure, contingency plans can be made in the U.S. and other countries to assist the foreseeable painful transitions for staff and facilities.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, most states have banned or considered banning the use of credit checks in hiring decisions, a screening tool that is widely used by employers. Using new Equifax data on employer credit checks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax data, and the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment data, we show that these bans increased employment of residents in the lowest-credit score census tracts. The largest gains occurred in higher-paying jobs and in the government sector. At the same time, using a large database of job postings, we show that employers increased their demand for other signals of applicants’ job performance, like education and experience. On net, the changes induced by these bans generate relatively worse outcomes for those with mid-to-low credit scores, for those under 22 years of age, and for blacks, groups commonly thought to benefit from such legislation.",

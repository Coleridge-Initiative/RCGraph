        "abstract": "ABSTRACTWelfare participation varies across the United States due to a myriad of welfare program differences specific to geographical locations. The purpose of this study is to examine Work First participation rates among the eligible poor utilizing a county-level analysis of North Carolina. Findings suggest the proportion of poor single mothers, region, county political orientation, and rates of disability receipt affect program participation. Findings highlight the importance of examining the welfare program at the county level and the dynamics of welfare participation, particularly in terms of how those in power affect access to social services among families in need.",

We find social work and efficiency engineer approaches to be distinct and influential with the street-level bureaucrat often conflicted, caught between helping and policing clients. In our study, conflicted managers often do daily casework on top of their managerial responsibilities. Although social work identities were the most common, efficiency engineer and conflicted identities were associated with more punitive and eligibility-focused routines. Overall, program managers’ identities correspond to how services are structured for clients within the constraints of the federal welfare-to-work program.",

        "abstract": "Attitudes toward racialized and redistributive policies like welfare are often thought of as a function of both principled ideological positions and the underlying racial attitudes a person holds. Kinder and Sanders (1996) look at racial resentment as one explanation, while Sniderman and his colleagues look to principled conservatism and authoritarianism as viable alternatives, claiming that racial resentment is merely proxying a legitimate race-neutral commitment to equality of opportunity. This article engages this debate through an experimental design which tests whether “hard work” is rewarded in a color-blind manner. The experimental design also affords scholars the opportunity to separate the effects of the two components of racial resentment: principled values and racial animus. The results show that American norms and implicit racism serve to uniquely privilege whites in a variety of ways.",

        "abstract": "U.S. welfare policy and devolution involve contradictions in implementing financial assistance as welfare workers must attempt to place clients with severe barriers in formal employment while meeting restrictive requirements. In interviews with North Carolina welfare-to-work program managers, the authors find that they engage in identity talk to construct images of themselves as effective workers despite these contradictions, using the symbolic identities of the “middle-class achiever” and the “thwarted advocate.” Location in rural counties with fewer resources leads to more polarizing strategies. The authors propose that service providers who face conflicting information and excessive frustration tend toward extremes, such as blaming clients or policymakers for program failures. This analysis contributes to the social psychological literature on inequality by demonstrating that reconciling contradictions as a service provider often entails certain strategic characterizations of clientele, both positive a...",

County-level expenditure data indicate that after state to local government devolution, only 45 of 100 counties met welfare maintenance of effort (MOE) budget requirements. Several important factors, including control over program eligibility and benefit levels, were significantly associated with MOE spending variation. Counties given more flexibility spent dramatically less than others. Many failed to meet MOE requirements without penalty, year after year. These issues raise serious questions about decentralization from both the budget and policy perspectives.",

Using data from a 2001 North Carolina household survey of low-income households, we analyze banking and credit behavior of current and recent welfare recipients in Charlotte, North Carolina. Other things equal, TANF families are 70% less likely than other low-income families to have a bank account and much more likely to have participated in a credit counseling program. Except for more frequent contact with bill collectors and credit counselors, leavers are no different from other low income families struggling to make ends meet. Race also matters when it comes to accessing mainstream banking and credit systems. Targeted programs help TANF families gain greater access to the financial mainstream. When it comes to specialization programs, however, those involved in the welfare system are not very different from other poor families. However, by virtue of their formal involvement with TANF, this population can be more efficien...",

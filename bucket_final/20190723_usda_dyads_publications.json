        "abstract": "Household scanner data are increasingly used to inform health policy such as sugar-sweetened beverage taxes. This article examines whether differences in the level of reported expenditures between IRI Consumer Network scanner panel and the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) lead to important differences in demand elasticities and policy simulation outcomes. Using each dataset, we estimated a structural consumer demand system with seven food groups and a numéraire good. To compare the two datasets on a level playing field, we went to great lengths to ensure that the explanatory variables in the two demand models were comparably constructed. Results indicate that scanner data households are not consistently more price responsive than the general population and underreported Consumer Network expenditures do not seem to result in systematic differences in price elasticities. The income elasticities are uniformly lower in Consumer Network than in CES for higher income households because of the positive association between income and the degree of underreporting. This, however, has limited effects on uncompensated price elasticities and policy simulations because food budget shares are small for higher income households. Overall, these findings support continued use of household scanner data in health policy research related to effects of price (dis)incentives.",

        "abstract": "In the USA, food producers can label their products as organic only if they are certified by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as having met comprehensive regulatory standards for environmental stewardship. In contrast, the Federal Government has not defined the term natural for most food products. Survey and experimental studies suggest that consumers are confused by the meanings of natural and USDA Organic on food labels, and often believe that these two label claims have similar meanings. In this paper, we examine whether this confusion influences aggregate retail food expenditures. High-frequency Google Trends data on the volume of web searches for “organic food” and for “natural food” are used as indicators of consumer interest in those food attributes. Results from a vector autoregression model show that web searches for both terms are correlated with retail purchases of organic food. Web searches for both help predict retail purchases. If consumers were aware of differences implied by the two label claims, searches for natural food would be uncorrelated with decisions to purchase organic products. These results are therefore evidence that consumers view the two claims as related, or even view the two claims as identical.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTWe apply the BLP random coefficient logit model demand model to fluid milk sales data from two north-south Italian cities: Turin and Naples. By virtue of their location and socioeconomic differences, these cities provide a natural experiment for contrasting consumer choices and retail market power related to milk physical and marketing characteristics. Results reveal that, regardless of location, consumers negatively value price increases, fat content and ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment. However, location matters with respect to brand and type of milk purchased. While in Turin (the higher-income region) demand for the leading manufacturers’ brands is the most price inelastic, in Naples consumers have the lowest price elasticities in case of cheaper milk, often small manufacturer or private label brands. Unlike previous studies, we do not find price elasticities for private labels to be consistently lower (or markups to be higher) compared to manufacturer brands, indicating that private labe...",

        "abstract": "Food deserts and their potential effects on diet and nutrition have received much attention from policymakers. While some research has found a correlation between food deserts and consumer outcomes, it is unclear whether food deserts truly affect consumer choices. In this article, we compare food prices in food deserts, defined as low‐income, low‐access census tracts, and nonfood deserts to observe whether and to what extent consumers face higher prices for a complete diet in food deserts. If a nutritionally complete diet costs significantly more in food deserts, resident consumers may be constrained from consuming healthier foods. We use store‐level scanner data from a nationally representative sample and calculate a census‐tract level Exact Price Index (EPI) based on a food basket defined by the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP). The EPI addresses potential biases from both product heterogeneity and variety availability. We find that the overall price impact of living in a food desert is small; low‐access areas have only 3.5% higher EPI than high‐access counterparts. However, consumers who are constrained to shop within their own census tracts face a much higher EPI than high‐access counterparts (9.2%). The higher EPI primarily comes from lower variety availability in food deserts.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOver the years, niche-differentiation strategies and food policies have pushed quality standards of European extra-virgin olive oil towards a product that has a sensory profile consisting of fruity, bitter and pungent notes, with such oils having excellent healthy features. However, it is unclear whether typical consumers are ready for a richer and more complex sensory profile than the neutral one historically found on the market. This potential discrepancy is investigated in the present study aiiming to determine whether current demand is able to appreciate this path of quality enhancement. Implicit prices for each and every attribute of extra-virgin olive oil with a focus on sensory characteristics were investigated using a hedonic price model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough confirming the importance of origin and terroir for extra-virgin olive oil, the results of the present study strongly confirm the discrepancy between what is currently valued on the market and what novel supply trends are trying to achieve in terms of the sensory properties of such products.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIncreasing consumer awareness about the direct link between the health quality of oils and their sensory profile appears to be necessary to make quality enhancement programs more successful on the market and hence more effective for companies. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The analysis was performed based on a unique data set on store-level retail prices provided by the Information Resources Inc. Further, alternative measures of retail concentration were considered, which included revenue and store selling space-based Herfindahl-Hirschman Index that were computed based on a Nielsen TDLinx data set on store characteristics. Results from a reduced-form empirical framework estimated via panel data techniques indicated that grocery retail concentration had a positive statistically significant effect on retail dairy product prices in the analyzed locations during the analyzed period of time. Specifically, a 10% increase in concentration was found to lead to a 0.46% rise in retail dairy product prices. This central result was robust to the way in which retail concentration was measured and was consistent with broader empirical evidence in the literature on retail market power.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The wine-growing sector is probably the area of agriculture that best expresses the binomial of production quality-territorial identity. In fact, the identification of agricultural production with the territory, its peculiarities and its atmospheres generates a relationship that is mutually advantageous and that the consumer perceives and values. This binomial is the basis that has generated the PDOs, which represent a winning solution for the success of productions that are otherwise fragmented and have little market “recognisability”. A current debate that has spread to various wine-growing areas questions the advisability of introducing sub-zoning based on quality levels in order to better promote the typical characteristics of each territory. The objective of this paper is to verify whether the strategy of sub-zoning based on the quality diversification of productions could constitute an appropriate tool to further promote a territory's productions. Towards this end, we have developed a discrete choice experiment to compare a new Chianti Classico DOCG type of excellence with other 4 DOCG Tuscan Sangiovese wines. The results show that introducing this new typology into a territory that has already been awarded the DOCG certification can represent a valid development strategy for the firm, as well as for territories.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The recent economic crisis has brought considerable changes also to food consumption: on one hand, many products have recorded consistent absolute declines in demand, while on the other hand, we have witnessed preferences shift towards low-cost foods or, in any event, foods of lower quality standards. In order to study these phenomena and, especially, the strategies firms adopt to confront them, the wine sector constitutes a particularly interesting focus due to its wide supply range and the elevated reactivity to price and income of demand. Our paper intends to take a close look at wine consumptions, focusing on the sales made on the Mass Retail Trading (MRT) channel from 2009 to 2013, and to conduct a thorough analysis of the performances of the single products, in view of pointing out the sector׳s overall trend, as well as the principal typologies of wine, in terms of their sales results in that period. Applying Latent Class Regression has permitted us to identify six explicative models of performances, demonstrating the effect on sales of the structural characteristics of productions and sales strategies.",

        "abstract": "Theories on the welfare and competitive effects of exclusive territories are numerous, yet they provide ambiguous results. This paper exploits a natural experiment in the U.S. brewing industry to identify the direction of change in welfare caused by the use of exclusive territories. On January 31, 1991, the state of Arkansas enacted legislation which mandated all beer manufacturers to have exclusive territory clauses in their agreements with distributors. To identify the effect, I employ brand-level sales data before and after the legal change both in Arkansas as well as in nearby Oklahoma and Texas. Results are broadly consistent with a positive relationship between the use of exclusive territories and welfare: the most credible results suggest that the legal mandate increased brand-level volume sales by 45%. I conduct several falsification exercises and robustness tests to rule out other possible explanations for this large effect.",

        "abstract": "Although the research investigating the market of functional foods proliferates, little empirical analysis has so far used actual market data. This study analyzes the demand for both conventional and functional alternatives sold in the Italian yogurt market using a scanner database of yogurt sales and a discrete choice (nested-logit) demand model, assessing also the role of health-related demographic characteristics as potential contributors to the market success of functional yogurts. The results show that, in the category analyzed, high prices deter the market success of some functional alternatives; this does not apply to drinkable ones, whose demand shows lower own-price and larger cross-price elasticities compared to the other functional alternatives. In addition, health-related consumer characteristics play an important role in shaping the demand for both conventional and functional yogurts in Italy. In particular, an aging, increasingly health-conscious population is likely to provide fertile ground for the success of functional yogurts in this market.",

        "abstract": "Ecolabelling is an increasingly important tool used in the promotion of sustainable forestry and fishery products around the world. Whether the consumer is actually paying a price premium for ecolabelled products is of fundamental importance as it indicates a return on the investment of sustainable practices, providing an incentive for producers to undertake such practices. This article seeks to address the question of whether or not an actual premium is being paid by consumers for ecolabelled seafood by conducting a hedonic analysis of Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)-certified frozen processed Alaska pollock products in the London metropolitan area in the UK market using scanner data. Regression results show a statistically significant premium of 14.2%. This implies the presence of market differentiation for sustainable seafood and the potential of the MSC’s fisheries certification programme to generate market incentives for sustainable fisheries practices.",

        "abstract": "Low-fat dairy products are key components of a healthy diet for all Americans. As the USDA increases its focus on nutrition and healthy eating, it is important to understand the underlying demands for dairy products, both the healthy and the less healthy ones. The consumption of fluid milk products has decreased over the last decade, whereas milk used for manufactured dairy products such as cheese, ice cream, yogurt, and butter, and for use as an ingredient in other food products, has risen. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of changes in demographic variables, retail prices, and total dairy expenditure on at-home consumption of dairy products, using purchase data from Nielsen 2007 Homescan (ACNielsen, New York, NY) data. To derive the demand elasticities for 16 products, a censored Almost Ideal Demand System model is used. Results reveal that demographic variables do have effects on the purchase of the 16 products, and own-price elasticities are 1 or greater for all 16 products for both uncompensated and compensated elasticities except 4: ice cream, refrigerated yogurt, processed cheese, and margarine. A substitution relationship exists among all fluid milk categories, natural and processed cheese, low-fat ice cream, and refrigerated yogurt, butter, and margarine.",

Non-parametric results reveal that although PL milk prices decrease as PL milk shares expand, eventually the effect is to increase the prices of manufacturers brands as well as the price gap between private labels and manufacturers brands. Econometric results further reveal that supermarkets exert some degree of price discrimination through controlling the brands of milk sold.",

Empirical results reveal that price increases due to oligopoly power outweighed those caused by the NEDC by nearly seven times. In fact, markups are estimated at approximately 25% of the retail milk price, translating into approximately a little less than $0.75/gallon. We also estimated that only around two-thirds of the raw milk price changes were passed forward to consumers. This helps explain why consumer prices have come down only little after elimination of the NEDC. In fact, the new milk income loss contract program, which basically provides partial price subsidies to farmers, has contributed to low raw milk prices that have generated substantial benefits to milk processors and retailers, modest benefits to farmers and consumers, all at the expense of taxpayers.",

        "abstract": "Product differentiation is well established as being the key source of the cereal industrys high price-cost margins. However, there is little consensus as to whether pricing collusion is also a source of profitability, and indeed, whether price even serves as a strategic variable in this industry. This paper seeks to resolve this debate by determining whether cereal firms strategically interact on price, and if so, estimating the extent that this increases margins relative to what perfect collusion among firms could achieve. Firms are estimated to cooperate on price to the extent that margins are 2.5 percentage points higher than what is possible under a Nash-Bertrand game. This raises margins by about 43% of what could be achieved under a perfectly executed agreement to fix prices. The results are consistent with studies in the literature that characterize the industrys pricing as \"approximately cooperative.\"",

In principle the method examined can produce a price index that takes account of the introduction of new products and quality changes in existing products. However, I isolate two key assumptions that have to be made in order to interpret the demand estimates into welfare measures. Using estimates of a brand-level demand system for ready-to-eat cereal, I demonstrate the empirical importance of the assumptions. For the data I use, depending on the interpretation of the demand estimates, a price index can range between a 35 increase over the five years examined to a 2.4 decrease.",

        "abstract": "The ready-to-eat cereal industry is characterized by high concentration, high price-cost margins, large advertising-to-sales ratios, and numerous introductions of new products. Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense non-price competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (1) that which is due to product differentiation; (2) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (3) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost markups. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with non-collusive pricing behavior, despite the high price- cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.",

        "abstract": "The National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey conducted in 2012 (FoodAPS-1) was an ambitious survey of Americans’ food acquisitions sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The survey was challenging due to its goals of collecting comprehensive acquisition information and including data from extant sources to broaden the survey’s research capabilities. Some challenges were foreseen, and efforts were taken to overcome them through survey design features. Other challenges came asa surprise. This paper shares the experiences of the authors and others at USDA with survey design, survey implementation, and post-survey processing of data to ensure the availability of high-quality data to the research community. Lessons from FoodAPS-1 can inform similar future data collections both in the U.S. and abroad.",

        "abstract": "Literature provides evidence of a highly price-elastic demand for organic food. However, most of the studies were conducted several years ago. In the meantime the organic market has matured. Consequently, results in literature need to be reviewed. This study specifically addresses own-price elasticity estimates for organic and conventional milk. The analysis is based on a household panel dataset of 20,000 German households. A two-step estimation procedure is applied. First, a probit regression examines which household characteristics affect the probability of buying organic milk. Second, a linear approximated almost ideal demand system provides detailed demand elasticity estimates. By using up-to-date data, distinguishing between different consumer groups, incorporating sociodemographic information and relying on a considerably large sample size this study is both an update and a refinement of previous research. In contrast to previous studies, econometric results suggest that demand for organic milk is absolutely price-inelastic in Germany. However, price responsiveness differs substantially between milk types and consumer groups. (EconLit classifications: C33, C34, D12). © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

With the availability of more extensive data, it is important to understand the characteristics of the data and implications of using different data sources on results of analyses. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) compare results between two sources of label information and (2) develop a better understanding of the effects of product claims and nutrition information on the value of products to consumers. Trans fat claims, organic claims, private label, package size, and several nutrients were found to influence implicit prices for soup products, and the results between the two data sources are comparable.",

To more fully understand the characteristics of these data, we conducted an analysis to determine whether household expenditures in the Nielsen Homescan panel are similar to the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Consumer Expenditure Diary Survey. We found that many differences in reported expenditures across the two datasets can be explained by such household demographics as female head, income, and household size, for example. The largest degrees of discrepancies across datasets occur for food categories containing more random-weight foods without universal product codes.

We simulate the overall impact of the regulation on consumers and producers using the Italian yogurt market as a case study, and data prior to the introduction of the policy. We quantify welfare losses incurred if accepted claims were false, and simulate scenarios where rejected truthful health claims are removed, considering also the case where the products carrying them exit the market. We find that consumers can incur large welfare losses if approved claims are untruthful; if truthful claims are instead denied both consumers and producers may incur losses, with consumers being penalised more than producers.",

        "abstract": "There has been significant growth in political, public, media, and academic interest in taxes and subsidies to encourage healthy food consumption over the past 3 years. The present systematic review, including an assessment of study quality, was conducted on new evidence published between January 2009 and March 2012 for the effect of food taxes and subsidies on consumption. Forty-three reports representing 38 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two of these were prospective randomized controlled trials that showed price changes were effective in both grocery store purchasing (subsidy) and away-from-home food purchasing (tax) contexts. The most robust modeled studies (considering substitution) showed larger effects for taxes on noncore foods or beverages for which there are close untaxed substitutes (such as soft drinks or \"unhealthy\" foods, based on nutrient profiling). Taxes and subsidies are likely to be an effective intervention to improve consumption patterns associated with obesity and chronic disease, with evidence showing a consistent effect on consumption across a range of tax rates emerging. Future research should use prospective study methods to determine the effect of taxes on diets and focus on the effect of taxation in conjunction with other interventions as part of a multisectoral strategy to improve diets and health.",

Consumer heterogeneity is accounted for with respect to age and income. Overall, our data is comprised of 7200 beer brand observations and 13 920 hypothetical consumer observations. Empirical results indicate that there is, indeed, home bias with respect to foreign beers, although it varies with consumer age and income.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a new model to empirically analyze retail pricing dynamics led by the competition between retailers, using fluid milk markets of three US metropolitan areas as a case study. The research is important for Chinese public policy makers to find the reasons of retail price fluctuations and provides policy makers with the direction and rationale to intervene in retailing markets. Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically applies dynamic oligopolistic competition model using Markov switching regression. The dataset used in this study includes 58 four-week-ending observations covering the period from March 1996 to July 2000 for three cities, Boston, Dallas, and Seattle. Findings - The empirical results illustrate the Markov switching regression not only successfully identifies the Markov perfect equilibrium in each market, but decomposes the retail price series into the corresponding equilibrium regimes. The forecasting power of the model is surprising so it can serve as a price monitor of the government. Additionally, the model reveals the different consumer welfare implications given different price regimes. The welfare analysis shows that consumers are most likely to be worse off through price fluctuations, while they are not always better off through a sticky (stable) price series in a market. Research limitations/implications - The first limitation of the paper is the retail price data is four-week ending. If a cycle evolves faster within four weeks, the model would overestimate the duration and underestimate the amplitude of cycles. So the study serves as an upper bound of the reality. The second limitation is the number of regimes. More than three regimes studied in a Markov switching regression may cause a series of empirical issues. However, if we integrate several regimes into one regime, we will lose rich information about the competitiveness of the markets. Practical implications - This paper is the first work to apply the dynamic pricing analysis to food industry by using fluid milk market as a case study. This paper empirically identifies four retail pricing regimes in fluid milk price series and evaluates the characteristics of the regimes. Social implications - This paper assesses the welfare implications of each pricing regime. The results show that the forecasting power of the model is strong in fluid milk retail market. Therefore, the study could serve as a price monitor to the public policymaker. Originality/value - This paper presents the first study to apply dynamic oligopolistic competition model to food marketing research.",

        "abstract": "What are the effects of a per-unit tax on the sales of a good? The answer in standard economics textbooks is a reduction in quantity and an increase in price. However, the homogeneous-product assumption in such treatments is not always correct because the taxed product is frequently sold under numerous differentiated brands. In general, quantity and price adjustments to a per-unit tax increase may vary differentially by brand, which implies that tax incidence requires a more thorough analysis than the standard one. In this paper, we test a popular theoretical prediction that the effects of a per-unit tax on sales may be different for low-quality brands than for high-quality brands. We exploit two exogenous variations on per-unit charges (excise taxes and shipping costs) in the beer industry to study if quality is an important determinant of equilibrium quantity, prices and advertising expenditures. We find that, when faced with higher per-unit charges, the equilibrium price and quantity of a brand are usually positively associated with its quality level; similarly, higher per-unit charges appear to provide firms with an incentive to shift advertising effort towards brands of higher quality. We discuss implications for public policy and firm profitability.",

        "abstract": "Californians recently passed Proposition 2, barring the use of cages in egg production in the state. Because most consumers are unknowledgeable of egg production practices, the appearance of Proposition 2 likely served as an information shock that potentially affected consumer demand. In this paper, we use scanner data to investigate the market effects of Proposition 2 by studying whether and how consumer demand for eggs changed in the months leading up to the vote in San Francisco and Oakland. Results indicate that demand for the types of eggs associated with higher animal welfare standards, cage free and organic, increased over time and in response to articles on the proposition whereas demand for other types of eggs fell. These results coupled with the finding that cage free and organic egg demand was virtually unchanged in a location unaffected by the vote, Dallas, suggests that Proposition 2 had a significant effect on consumer preferences for eggs increasing demand for cage free and organic eggs by 180% and 20%, respectively.",

To assess the plausibility of different models, the increase in marginal cost resulting from the tax increase is exploited: observed prices in the post-increase period are compared to the prices that should be observed under various pricing models. Three types of models are analyzed: Bertrand-Nash, leadership, and collusion. Results indicate that extreme cases of collusion can be confidently ruled out while several models may explain the observed prices equally well.",

Unlike previous studies, this work estimates the own- and cross-advertising elasticities in addition to price elasticities. Positive and negative cross-advertising elasticities imply the presence of both cooperative and predatory effects of advertising expenditures across brands; however, the former effect appears to dominate suggesting that advertising increases the overall demand for beer. We discuss the implications of these results in this industry.",

While existing empirical models of strategic interaction typically consider only parts of the more general problem, this paper presents a more comprehensive alternative. Marketing decision are dynamically optimal, consistent with optimal consumer choice, and responsive to rival decisions. Using a single-market case study that consists of five years of four-weekly data on ready-to-eat cereal sales, prices, and new brand introductions, we test several hypotheses regarding the nature of strategic interaction among several rival manufacturers. We find that cereal manufacturers price and introduce new brands cooperatively in the same period, but behave more competitively when dynamic reactions are included.",

Results indicate sales of recalled brands declined roughly 22% after a recall.

There is no evidence that nonrecalled brands experienced sales losses.",

        "abstract": "In an imperfectly competitive industry, differentiated products compete with each other with price rather than quantity as the strategic variable. Several previous studies have employed a generalized Nash Bertrand model: Liang (1989), Cotterill (1994), Cotterill, Putsis and Dhar (2000), and Kinoshita, Suzuki, Kawamura, Watanabe and Kaiser (2001); however, only Liang has explored the theoretical foundations of that model. This paper generalizes the Liang two good model to three goods. A surprising and important result follows. Price conjectural variations do not exist in models with 3 or more goods. Price reaction functions, however, exist in multiple good models. We estimate them jointly with a brand level demand system to evaluate the total impact of a brand manager?s price change on own quantity. In a differentiated product market this is a useful addition to a partial demand elasticity approach because a change in one brand?s price typically engenders a price reaction by other brands which affects own quantity via substantial cross price elasticities among substitutes. Strategic pricing in the Boston fluid milk market was also influenced by the existence of a raw milk price support program, the Northeast Dairy Compact. We find that the advent of the Compact was a focal point event that crystallized a shift away from Nash Bertrand to more cooperative pricing. If the downstream market is not competitive one needs to consider strategic price reactions when designing and evaluating agricultural price programs. Key Words: oligopoly, price conjectural variations, brand level demand elasticities, focal point collusion",

        "abstract": "There were two parts to this study. Part 1 evaluated the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream isolates within the Southern Health Board (SHB) of Ireland from 1992 to 2003 by retrospective surveillance of all such isolates of patients reported from SHB hospitals to our laboratory database during that period. Part 2 reviewed candidaemia cases occurring in Cork University Hospital (CUH) from 1999 to 2003 using surveillance of all positive blood culture isolates in CUH microbiology laboratory during the 5-year period. In part 1, 250 Candida bloodstream isolates were reported in the SHB over 12 years. There was a pattern of decreasing percentage of C. albicans with time. Whereas in part 2, 63 cases of candidaemia were identified in CUH from 1999 to 2003. Candida albicans constituted 50% of all isolates, while C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata accounted for 21.2% and 18.2% respectively. Average annual incidence rate was 0.48 episodes/1000 admissions and 0.70 episodes/10 000 patient-days. Vascular catheters were the commonest source of candidaemia (61.9%) followed by the urinary tract (12.7%). Risk factors included exposure to multiple antibiotics (75%); central vascular catheterization (73%); multiple colonization sites (71%); severe gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction (54%) and acute renal failure (43%). Crude 7-day and 30-day mortality rates were 20.6% and 39.7% respectively. Logistic regression multivariate analysis identified the following to be independent predictors for mortality: age > or =65 years [odds ratio (OR) 7.2, P = 0.013]; severe GI dysfunction (OR 10.6, P = 0.01); acute renal failure (OR 7.6, P = 0.022); recent/concurrent bacteraemia (OR 5.2, P = 0.042); endotracheal intubation (OR 7.7, P = 0.014); while major surgery was associated with a better prognosis (OR 0.05, P = 0.002). Appropriate antifungal treatment was also found to be associated with survival (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001). The epidemiology of Candida bloodstream isolates within our health board had changed over the years. Incidence and mortality of candidaemia were relatively high in our hospital. Dysfunction of major organ systems and recent bacteraemia were found to predict mortality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a dynamic state-space AIDS model of brand share. The model structure separates the transitory and permanent components of the data and offers several key advantages over conventional share modelling approaches. Firstly, it provides a general framework to examine the time series properties of brand share. Secondly, it provides an accurate assessment of the short-run effects of marketing mechanics. Thirdly, the extracted permanent component can be used in a separate auxiliary analysis of the long-run effects of marketing mechanics. The model is applied to a small segment of the toiletries category comprising four differentiated brands and covering over five years of quad-weekly time series data. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the conventional AIDS model and indicate short-run competition on the basis of price and promotional activity. Long-run analysis, however, suggests that such activity exerts no sustainable impact on the share of competing brands. Out of sample forecasts are satisfactory and provide an improvement over both a standard dynamic AIDS and time-varying-parameter MNL model. Brand share forecasts, in conjunction with price and segment value forecasts, are then used to produce brand volume forecasts.",

        "abstract": "On July 11, 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a final rule amending its food-labeling regulations to require that trans FA be declared in the nutrition label of conventional foods and dietary supplements. The effective date of this final rule is January 1, 2006. This places some urgency on increasing the number and types of currently available foods for which there are trans-fat data. Compositional databases on trans fat content of food are currently limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the trans-fat content of a wide range of foods prior to the effective date of the new regulation. AOAC Official Method of Analysis 996.01 was modified for the analysis of trans fat in noncereal products. Food products for analysis were selected on the basis of market share and data from the USDA's 1994–1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals. Foods were purchased from local supermarkets, weighed, hydrolyzed, converted to FAME, and analyzed by GC. The results showed that trans fat (g/100 g fat) ranged from 0.0 to 48.8 in bread, cake, and related products; from 14.9 to 27.7 in margarines; from 7.7 to 35.3 in cookies and crackers; from 24.7 to 38.2 in frozen potatoes; from 0.0 to 17.1 in salty snacks; from 0.0 to 13.2 in vegetable oils and shortenings; from 0.0 to 2.2 in salad dressings and mayonnaises; and from 0.0 to 2.0 in dry breakfast cereals. Serving sizes for the foods included in this survey ranged from 12 to 161 g, and trans-fat levels ranged from 0.0 to 7.2 g/serving. The significant differences in trans-fat content in products within each food category are due to differences in the type of fats and oils used in the manufacturing processes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis study examines trends in the prevalence of price promotions among packaged food and beverage purchases, differences in prevalence by household race/ethnicity or income, and the association between price promotions and the nutritional profile of purchases.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis cross-sectional study utilizes a dataset of 90 million purchases from 38,744 (2008) to 45,042 (2012) US households in 2008-2012. Chi-square tests were used to examine whether the proportion of purchases with price promotions changed over time or differed by household race/ethnicity or income. T-tests were used to compare purchased products' nutritional profiles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of price promotions among packaged food and beverage purchases increased by 8% and 6%, respectively, from 2008 to 2012, with both reaching 34% by 2012. Higher-income households had greater proportions of purchases with price promotions than lower-income households. Asian households had the highest proportion of purchases with any price promotion, followed by non-Hispanic whites. While total price-promoted packaged food purchases had higher mean energy, total sugar, and saturated fat densities than purchases with no price promotions, absolute differences were small.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrevalence of price promotions among US household purchases increased from 2008 to 2012 and was greater for higher-income households. No clear associations emerged between presence of price promotions and nutritional quality of purchases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNutrient claims are a commonly used marketing tactic, but the association between claims and nutritional quality of products is unknown. The objective of this study was to examine trends in the proportion of packaged food and beverage purchases with a nutrient claim, whether claims are associated with improved nutritional profile, and whether the proportion of purchases with claims differs by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis cross-sectional study examined nutrient claims on more than 80 million food and beverage purchases from a transaction-level database of 40,000 US households from 2008 to 2012. χ2 Tests were used to examine whether the proportion of purchases with a low/no-content claim changed over time or differed by race/ethnicity or household socioeconomic status. Pooled transactions were examined using t-tests to compare products' nutritional profiles overall and by food and beverage group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen percent of food and 35% of beverage purchases had a low-content claim. Prevalence of claims among purchases did not change over time. Low-fat claims were most prevalent for both foods and beverages (10% and 19%, respectively), followed by low-calorie (3% and 9%), low-sugar (2% and 8%), and low-sodium (2% for both) claims. Compared to purchases with no claim, purchases with any low-content claim had lower mean energy, total sugar, total fat, and sodium densities. However, the association between particular claim types and specific nutrient densities varied substantially, and purchases featuring a given low-content claim did not necessarily offer better overall nutritional profiles or better profiles for the claimed nutrient, relative to products without claims. In addition, there was substantial heterogeneity in associations between claims and nutrient densities within food and beverage groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVariations in nutrient density by claim type and food and beverage group suggests that claims may have differential utility for certain foods or nutrients and, in some cases, may mislead about the overall nutritional quality of the food.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates the external validity of a food value scale by determining the extent to which the relative importance placed on eleven food values explain demand for organic eggs and milk as reflected in scanner data representing consumers’ actual purchases in grocery stores. A conceptual model is also developed showing that the relationship between food values and food demand can be used to infer people’s beliefs about the merits of organic vs. non-organic food. Results indicate that demand for organic eggs and milk, as revealed in the household scanner data, is significantly influenced by respondents’ food values. The results show that people who are relatively more concerned about the environment and tradition exhibited higher demand for organic milk and eggs relative to non-organic milk and eggs, suggesting a belief that organics are more traditional and environmentally friendly. The results also show that people who are relatively more concerned about price and convenience exhibit lower demand for organic milk and eggs. Overall, the findings indicate that food values are significantly related to actual grocery store purchases, suggesting that the food values scale has the potential to explain consumer choice and guide new product development and marketing decisions.",

Meanwhile, prescription drugs can alleviate the symptoms of or control many diet-related chronic diseases, but these drugs may also weaken the resolve to follow recommended diets (moral hazard). Design: We measure the effect of a diagnosis of chronic disease and subsequent pharmacological treatment on the dietary quality of food purchases using a large panel data set of US consumers. We estimate the effect of prescription drug utilization on food purchases for the following chronic diseases: type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, and obesity. Participants: Panelists of the Information Resources, Inc consumer panel. Measures: Dietary quality is measured as purchases of (1) food groups (ie, fruit, vegetables, and sweets) and (2) nutrients (ie, saturated fat, fiber, sodium, sugar, and total calories). Analysis: Linear regression with mixed effects on pooled panel (household random effects, city fixed effects). Results/Conclusion: We do not find strong effects of either diagnosis or pharmacological treatment of diet-related disease on food purchases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The most commonly used functional forms in measuring market response functions are the linear and log-linear (double-log) specifications. Although the two models are mutually non-nested, they are both nested within the class of Box-Cox regression models. This enables one to test the statistical validity of these two models using nested tests, the power characteristics of which are better established relative to non-nested hypotheses tests, at least in large samples. In this paper, an application of the Lagrange multiplier (LM) test to determine the validity of linear, log-linear, and attraction-type formulations of market share models is illustrated using marketing data. The test is easy to compute and involves running only one extra linear regression. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to study the properties of the test for samples of varying size and different levels of error variance. The simulation results indicate that the LM test should not be used with samples of less than 100 observations. We also compare the performance of the LM test to that of the P E test developed by MacKinnon, White, and Davidson for non-nested models. The results show that the P E test has a lower probability of a type 1 error for all sample sizes and different error levels. The power of the LM test, however, is greater when the error variance of the true model is high, given a fixed sample size.",

        "abstract": "Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A number of U.S. jurisdictions have levied volume-based specific SSB taxes. This study estimated baseline mean SSB prices across categories and sizes as this will help to determine the percentage increase in price resulting from the imposition of specific taxes. Data on food store SSB prices were collected in 2017 in Cook County, IL, St. Louis City/County, MO, Oakland, CA, and Sacramento, CA (N = 11,767 product-level observations from 581 stores). Data were weighted to represent volume sold by category and size. Mean prices per ounce were computed across categories and sizes. Linear regression models, clustered on store, were run to estimate associations between price per ounce and product characteristics, neighborhood (linked by census tract) characteristics, store type, and site. Weighted summary statistics show that the mean price of SSBs was 4.8 cents/oz. Soda was least expensive (3.4 cents/oz), followed by sports drinks (4.8 cents/oz), juice drinks (5.2 cents/oz), ready-to-drink tea/coffee (7.8 cents/oz), and energy drinks (19.9 cents/oz). Prices were higher for individual-sized (9.6 cents/oz) compared to family-sized drinks (>1 L/multi-pack; 3.5 cents/oz). Regression results revealed that prices were lower in stores in majority non-Hispanic black tracts and varied by beverage characteristics and store type but not tract-level socioeconomic status. Given substantial variation in prices by SSB category, a penny-per-ounce SSB tax, if fully passed through, would increase soda prices by 29% versus 5% for energy drinks, highlighting the potential importance of different specific tax rates across beverage categories.",

The greater price rigidity for high-quality brands leads to asymmetric effects of monetary policy on the rich and the poor. For instance, monetary policy shocks have larger real effects on high-income consumers who purchase more high-quality brands. This means that the rich benefit more from expansionary monetary shocks but suffer more from contractionary shocks than the poor. I build a menu-cost model with vertically differentiated products. The model predicts that monetary policy shocks have an approximately four times larger impact on the consumption of high-quality brands.",

        "abstract": "During the past decade, dozens of countries, regions, and cities have enacted taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). They have been primarily motivated by a desire to raise prices, reduce sales and consumption, improve population health, and raise revenue. This review outlines the economic rationale for SSB taxes and illustrates their predicted effects. It reviews the research on the effects of these taxes on retail prices, sales, cross-border shopping, consumption, and product availability. The evidence indicates that the amount by which taxes increase retail prices (also called the pass-through of the tax) varies by jurisdiction, ranging from less than 50% to 100% of the tax. Sales tend to decrease significantly in the taxing jurisdiction, although this seems to be partly offset by residents increasingly shopping outside of the taxing jurisdiction (i.e., engaging in cross-border shopping). Overall, taxes lower consumption of the taxed beverages by adults, although not for all types of beverages or all groups of consumers. We conclude with suggestions for improving the design of such taxes and directions for future research. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Nutrition Volume 39 is August 21, 2019. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.",

We find that the entry of a grocery store has no significant effect on the frequency of price change at incumbent grocers in the same zip code, but the entry of a Walmart results in more frequent price changes. Looking across time, price change frequency increases during expansions and decreases during downturns; however, all else being equal, the presence of a Walmart mitigates much of this cyclical behavior, compared to other grocery store competitors that have no differential effect across the business cycle.",

        "abstract": "Background. Lower-income families in the United States are at increased risk for food insecurity and have higher rates of tobacco use. Many retailers accepting government food assistance benefits also sell tobacco products, whose marketing promotes smoking initiation and undermines quit attempts. We examined the presence of tobacco marketing in authorized retailers in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and/or Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), compared with nonauthorized retailers. Method. A nationally representative sample of tobacco retailers in the contiguous United States (N = 2,054) were audited for tobacco marketing in 2015. Using generalized estimating equations, we examined the association between WIC and SNAP authorization and presence of tobacco marketing, adjusted for store type and neighborhood demographics. Results. Both WIC-authorized (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.1, 2.4]) and SNAP-authorized retailers (OR 2.3, 95% CI [1.7, 3.1]) had greater odds of displaying interior tobacco price promotions, compared with stores that were not WIC/SNAP authorized. SNAP-authorized stores (compared with nonauthorized) had almost 3 times greater odds of displaying interior tobacco advertisements (OR 2.9, 95% CI [1.9, 4.5]), while WIC-authorized retailers had 80% lower odds of displaying exterior tobacco advertisements (OR 0.2, 95% CI [0.1, 0.3]). Conclusion. Millions of lower-income American families may be disproportionately exposed to tobacco marketing at food retailers. Federal, state, and local policies could create healthier retail environments by restricting the marketing and availability of tobacco products and increasing promotions and access to healthy food options.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between price and sales volume of non-alcoholic sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), diet drinks, sweets and chocolates, including own and cross price elasticity to further quantify the potential impact of price. The study was based on retail scanner data for grocery sales from retail outlet chains in Denmark during the year 2008–2015. A fixed-effects model was used to estimate the association between price and sales volume, using own price and cross price elasticity. Sales volume of all sugary products except for chocolates were significantly negatively associated with price. Own price elasticity varied from −0.3 to −0.4 for drinks and sweets indicating that a 10% increase in price would cause a reduction in sales by 3 or 4%. A 10% increase in price of carbonated SSBs would increase sales of diet drinks by 7%. Cross price elasticities for other products were not significant. The results of the present study demonstrated significant negative associations between changes in price and changes in the sale of SSBs, diet drinks and sweets.",

        "abstract": "Beef imports in Chile have increase annually by close to 10% in the past 10 years, threatening the national industry. Understanding the importance of different attributes may help guide a strategy for the local beef industry. Thus, the goal of the study was to identify which attributes observable at the point of sale influence the beef buying process. The sample was a set of 406 price observations, search attributes (intrinsic and extrinsic cues), and credence attributes of differentiated beef. The study was conducted in 15 counties in the Metropolitana region in Chile, and the results indicated that among differentiated beef, the highest valued attributes were low fat and natural. In addition, Angus and Wagyu beef, breeds associated by consumers with increased tenderness and flavor, were highly valued. Finally, processed beef products (portioned, marinated, or seasoned) were more valued than unprocessed products. An important and unexpected result is that highlighting Chile as the country of origin is a negatively valued attribute.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nCigar sales have increased in the USA in recent years. A growing proportion of cigar sales are of flavoured varieties, many bearing ambiguous or 'concept' flavour descriptions (eg, Jazz). This study assessed US cigar sales by flavour category (ie, concept flavoured, characterising flavoured and tobacco), at national, regional and state levels.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSales of cigarillos, large cigars and little cigars from chain, franchise and convenience stores, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, drug, dollar and club stores, and military commissaries during 2012-2016 were acquired from the Nielsen Company. US national-level and state-level sales, including District of Columbia, were analysed by flavour category. Flavour descriptors were classified as 'tobacco', 'characterising' or 'concept', based on Universal Product Code (UPC)-linked characteristics and brand website and consumer review descriptions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCigar sales increased by 29% during 2012-2016, driven by a 78% increase in cigarillo sales. The proportion of concept-flavoured sales increased from 9% to 15%, while the proportion of sales decreased for tobacco (50% to 49%) and characterising flavours (eg, cherry) (41% to 36%). Cigarillos had the greatest increase in unique concept flavour descriptions (17 to 46 unique UPCs), with most sales occurring among Sweet, Jazz and Green Sweets concept flavours. By US region, total and concept-flavoured cigarillo sales were highest in the South.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFlavoured cigars are increasingly labelled with concept flavours, including in areas with flavoured tobacco sales restrictions. Cigarillos are driving recent increases in US cigar and concept-flavoured cigar sales. It is important to consider concept flavours when addressing flavoured tobacco product sales and use.",

        "abstract": "We examine how soda sales changed due to the campaign attention and election out- come of a local excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), most commonly referred to as a soda tax. Using panel data of beverage sales from university retailers in Berkeley, California, we estimate that soda purchases relative to control beverages significantly dropped immediately after the election, months before the tax was implemented in the city of Berkeley or on campus. Supplemental scanner data from off campus drug stores reveal this result is not unique to the university setting. Our findings suggest soda tax media coverage and election outcomes can have larger effects on purchasing behavior than the tax itself.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the fight against obesity governments have pursued various policies to increase soda prices in the hope of discouraging consumption. Previous studies examining the efficacy of taxing sodas have generalized sales taxes to other taxes and assumed that imposing a tax is as salient as imposing a direct price hike. In this research, the authors recognize that most consumers do not pay much attention to how taxes differ in application. As such, the authors disassociate effects of sales taxes on soda demand from direct price increases, estimate pass-through rates of excise taxes in the soda market, and compare the efficacy of the two taxes at three tax levels. They find that, for all three tax levels, imposing an excise tax on sodas drives much steeper declines in the overall demand than a sales tax does. The findings suggest that failing to distinguish between tax types leads to a biased estimation of tax effects on reducing soda consumption. This research provides important implications to help pol...",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAt least four varieties of little filtered cigars (LFCs) violate the US prohibition on flavoured cigarettes other than menthol. This study characterises the sales of prohibited products and other LFCs by flavour category and pack size, as well as the price of LFCs relative to cigarettes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing retail sales data for 2016, we computed the sales volume in dollars and equivalent units and the percentage of total sales by flavour and pack size for the USA by region and state. Paired t-tests compared the prices for LFCs and cigarettes sold in same-sized packs and cartons.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLFC sales totalled 24 033 equivalent units per 100 000 persons in 2016. Flavoured LFC varieties accounted for almost half (47.5%) of the total sales. LFCs were sold in 12 different pack sizes, but 79.7% of sales were packs of 20. The price of 20-packs averaged $2.41 (SD=$1.49), which was significantly less than cigarettes (M=$5.90, SD=$0.85). Regional differences suggest a greater proportion of menthol/mint LFCs and lower prices in the South than in other regions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nClassifying all LFCs as cigarettes would require that they be offered in a minimum package of 20, eliminate flavoured varieties other than menthol and increase prices through applicable state and local cigarette taxes.",

        "abstract": "This article uses a stage model of ethical decision-making to explain consumersâ€™ inclination toward ethical product alternatives. The current paper enhances the stage-model approach by considering egoistic purchasing motives and gender as moderating variables. The current study shows that the effect of negative affect on ethical purchasing intention is mediated by ethical judgement and moral obligation. Interestingly, the mediation effect is more pronounced for male respondents. Furthermore, egoistic purchasing motives moderate the effects of the stage-model components on ethical judgment as well as on ethical purchasing intention. These moderation effects are boosted or altered if gender is considered as moderator. Based on the empirical results and considering study limitations, the paper presents practical implications and avenues for future research.",

        "abstract": "In health, stated preference data from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are commonly used to estimate discrete choice models that are then used for forecasting behavioral change, often with the goal of informing policy decisions. Data from DCEs are potentially subject to hypothetical bias. In turn, forecasts may be biased, yielding substandard evidence for policymakers. Bias can enter both through the elasticities as well as through the model constants. Simple correction approaches exist (using revealed preference data) but are seemingly not widely used in health economics. We use DCE data from an experiment on smokers in the US. Real-world data are used to calibrate the scale of utility (in two ways) and the alternative-specific constants (ASCs); several innovations for calibration are proposed. We find that embedding revealed preference data in the model makes a substantial difference to the forecasts; and that how models are calibrated also makes a substantial difference.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe tobacco industry (TI) can act to undermine the impact of tobacco tax increases by adopting various pricing strategies. Little is known about strategies used across the European Union (EU), except for the UK.\n\n\nAIM\nTo examine pricing strategies adopted by the TI in the EU, and whether they differ by cigarette price segment, or between manufactured and roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is a longitudinal analysis of commercial pricing data for manufactured and RYO cigarettes from 23 EU countries in 2006-2017. Price and revenue trends were explored. Linear regression estimated the average annual change in revenue, and linear fixed-effects panel regression models were used to explore the association between changes in median revenue (net of tax and adjusted for inflation) and tax increases in different price segments of manufactured cigarettes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the 11-year period price gaps were observed in all countries. The average annual adjusted median net revenue per pack increased in 19 of 23 countries for manufactured and RYO cigarettes. A tax increase was associated with a significant decrease of -€0.09 in adjusted median net revenue per pack (95% CI -0.16 to -0.03) in the cheap cigarette price segment, while no change was detected in the expensive cigarette price segment (-€0.05, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAcross the EU, pricing strategies adopted by the TI maintained or increased price gaps and retained cheaper tobacco products in the market, diminishing the impact of tobacco tax increases. Further strengthening of tobacco taxation policy is needed to maximise public health impact.",

        "abstract": "Most large US food retailers and restaurants have made pledges to sell only cage‐free eggs. If the pledges are upheld, about 75% of the egg laying flock will have to be converted to cage‐free by the year 2025. However, it is an open question as to whether the market will support such a change. To address this issue, a national survey of over 2,000 US egg consumers was conducted to estimate cage‐free egg demand among consumers exposed to different types of information. We find a high degree of heterogeneity in willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) for cage‐free eggs. Half of the consumers are WTP no more than a $0.30/dozen premium for cage‐free eggs; however, the mean premium is $1.16/dozen, suggesting a small fraction of consumers are willing to pay sizeable amounts for the cage‐free label. Ultimately, the results suggest there is potential for the market‐share for cage‐free eggs to rise above the current state even at premiums as high as $1.00/dozen. However, even at much more modest price premiums, the potential for cage‐free eggs to attain majority market share is unlikely, particularly if conventional eggs advertise other desirable attributes. We also find that retailers who completely remove more affordable, conventional eggs are likely to experience a significant increase in the share of consumers who choose not to buy eggs.",

        "abstract": "I examine the competitive effects of mandated exclusive territories in the US beer industry. Theory is ambiguous as to the competitive impacts of this vertical practice. Using scanner data from a large number of grocery stores, I empirically examine the impact on beer prices, quantities, and number of brands sold after Wisconsin mandated that brewers must assign exclusive wholesale territories in 2006. Reduced form results from a differences-in-differences model using several control groups and a synthetic control show that the mandates increased prices and reduced quantity of craft beer. Overall number of brands sold decreased as well and craft brewers were the most negatively impacted. Findings suggest that the mandate gave protection to wholesalers and caused an increase in the costs of distribution and reduced competition in the brewing industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper explores the couponing strategies when a national brand competes with a store brand by discussing three different kinds of coupons: manufacturers’ coupons, retailers’ national brand coupons, and retailers’ private label coupons. We show that the positioning of the private label product in terms of quality and feature differentiation from the national brand play an important role in determining the face value of the manufacturer's coupon and retailer's national brand coupon. In particular, a larger degree of feature differentiation drives the manufacturer to increase its coupon value, and the retailer responds by decreasing the value of its own coupon for the brand name product. In contrast, with an increase in private label quality, the couponing strategies taken by the manufacturer and the retailer depend on which segment of consumers is in the market for the private label product. Additionally, the retailer's private label coupon value is only impacted by the difference in consumers’ willingness to pay but not by private label positioning. Empirical results on the effect of feature differentiation on national brand and private label coupon values are consistent with our theoretical predictions.",

        "abstract": "We construct panel price indexes using retail scanner data that allow comparisons of consumption cost across space and time. Two types of panel indexes are examined: the rolling-window panel extensions of the multilateral Cave-Christensen-Diewert (CCD) index with the Törnqvist index as its elements, and of the multilateral Gini-Eltetö-Köves-Szulc (GEKS) index using the Fisher ideal index as its elements. The rolling window method maintains the nonrevisability of published index numbers while it allows index numbers for new periods and locations be calculated and the basket of items be updated. Meanwhile, the multilateral structure of price comparison eliminates significant downward drift in standard chained indexes. Using county-level bilateral and panel indexes based on retail beverage scanner data, we experimentally adjust for purchasing parity the portion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits that participants spend on beverages. Accounting for temporal and spatial cost differences causes over 2% of SNAP allotment spent on beverages be reallocated, or approximately a 5% change in allotment on average for a county. About 90% of the relocated SNAP fund is to adjust for spatial differences in food cost. We also compare SNAP allotments implied by the retail scanner data indexes with those implied by indexes based on the USDA Quarterly Food-at-Home Price Database (QFAHPD). The treatment of unit values and product quality may have contributed to the significant differences observed between the retail scanner data indexes and the QFAHPD indexes.",

        "abstract": "Leakage occurs when partial regulation of consumer products results in increased consumption of these products in unregulated domains. This article quantifies plastic leakage from the banning of plastic carryout bags. Using quasi-random policy variation in California, I find the elimination of 40 million pounds of plastic carryout bags is offset by a 12 million pound increase in trash bag purchases—with small, medium, and tall trash bag sales increasing by 120%, 64%, and 6%, respectively. The results further reveal 12–22% of plastic carryout bags were reused as trash bags pre-regulation and show bag bans shift consumers towards fewer but heavier bags. With a substantial proportion of carryout bags already reused in a way that avoided the manufacture and purchase of another plastic bag, policy evaluations that ignore leakage effects overstate the regulation's welfare gains.",

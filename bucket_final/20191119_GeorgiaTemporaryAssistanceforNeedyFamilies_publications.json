        "abstract": "ABSTRACTEmploying the methodology of Foucault’s genealogy, this article provides an in-depth exploration of welfare in the United States and the state of Georgia. An analysis of federal welfare policies and specific policies related to the state of Georgia is interrogated and explored in an effort to reveal the historical contingencies of racism, individualism, (loss of) entitlement and removal from welfare rolls and the discourses that create and maintain today’s welfare policies. This article challenges how leisure is conceptualized and accessed by those who receive welfare in the United States. A discussion of work and leisure is presented, along with implications for leisure professionals.",

        "abstract": "We propose the use of Google online search data for nowcasting and forecasting the number of food stamps recipients. We perform a large out-of-sample forecasting exercise with almost 3000 competing models with forecast horizons up to 2 years ahead, and we show that models including Google search data statistically outperform the competing models at all considered horizons. These results hold also with several robustness checks, considering alternative keywords, a falsification test, different out-of-samples, directional accuracy and forecasts at the state-level.",

        "abstract": "Mothers who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) are at increased risk for experiencing workplace instability in the form of absence from paid employment and job loss. In a cross-sectional study, we investigate if experiences of IPV inhibit work stability among low-income women as well as if the receipt of child care subsidies has a moderating effect on the relationship. Using data from the Illinois Families Study, we tested the relationships between IPV, work outcomes, and recipient of child care subsidies in a series of multivariate regressions. Findings indicate IPV is associated with reduced hours worked among low-income mothers and increased unemployment among low-income mothers. However, both of these relationships are moderated by receipt of child care subsidies suggesting that mothers who experience IPV can maintain employment at the same level as women not experiencing IPV with receipt of child care subsidies. Our findings indicate the importance of receiving child care subsidies among low-income mothers and support subsidy accessibility to survivors of IPV. Results of our study are limited in regard to the age of the data, the cross-sectional use of the data, and the lack of a control group that was not receiving any type of government assistance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Parental history of childhood maltreatment victimization is a widely studied risk factor for child maltreatment perpetration, a process referred to as the intergenerational transmission of child maltreatment (ITCM). Using a sample of mothers receiving welfare in Illinois, we examined how maternal history of physical abuse and neglect was associated with perpetration of physical abuse and neglect against mothers' own children. In addition, we investigated whether the mediating effects of depressive symptoms on ITCM differ by subtype of maltreatment using PROCESS Macro analyses as developed by Hayes (2017).We found that maternal physical abuse history increased the risk of offspring physical abuse and neglect; maternal neglect history was associated with offspring neglect only. In addition, we found that mothers' depressive symptoms mediated the associations of neglect and physical abuse victimization with perpetration of physical abuse; depressive symptoms did not explain any aspect of neglect perpetration.",

        "abstract": "Objective \nThe present study investigated whether risk factors vary by subtypes of child maltreatment investigations, with particular attention to the role of cumulative risks affecting child maltreatment. \n \nBackground \nBuilding and expanding on prior work finding that the accumulation of risk factors puts children at risk for maltreatment, this work examines child physical abuse and neglect investigations separately. \n \nMethod \nA sample of 1,181 low-income families was randomly selected from one state's public assistance caseload. Multinomial logistic regression was used to model risk factors associated with 3 subtypes of investigated child maltreatment reports. \n \nResults \nRisk factors for each type of child maltreatment were different. As the number of risk factors families experienced increased, the likelihood of child maltreatment increased across all subtypes of maltreatment. Specifically, families with 5 or more risk factors were at greater risk of maltreatment than families with 2 or fewer risk factors. \n \nConclusion \nThe threshold effect of cumulative risks demonstrates that families may be able to tolerate a moderate number of risk factors; however, beyond a certain number of risks, families may not be able to cope adequately with the stress, and the likelihood of maltreating their children dramatically increases. \n \nImplications \nTo alleviate child maltreatment, prevention programs need to address diverse risks simultaneously, rather than focus on a particular risk factor.",

        "abstract": "Family violence has been associated with various negative outcomes among children and adolescents. Yet, less is known about how unique forms of physical family violence contribute to externalizing and internalizing behaviors based on a child's developmental stage. Using data from the Illinois Families Study and administrative Child Protective Services data, we explored the relation between 3 types of physical family violence victimization and externalizing and internalizing behaviors among a sample of 2,402 children and adolescents. After including parent and family level covariates in Poisson regressions, we found that a unique form of family violence victimization was associated with increased externalizing behaviors among children at each age group: exposure to physical intimate partner violence (IPV) among children ages 3-5, exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling among children ages 6-12, and child physical abuse among adolescents ages 13-18. No form of physical family violence was significantly associated with internalizing behaviors for children in any age group. Including exposure to the child maltreatment of a sibling is crucial when attempting to contextualize children's responses to family violence and providing comprehensive services in an effort to enhance the well-being of all children in a family.

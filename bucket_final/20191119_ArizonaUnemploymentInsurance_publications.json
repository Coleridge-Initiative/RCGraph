        "abstract": "The US nuclear testing moratorium has reduced employment levels at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). This study analyses the incidence, duration, and determinants of on-the-job search activity of NTS employees who expect permanent job losses. Empirical results support theoretical predictions originating from search theory, and suggest that high skilled white collar workers are the most likely to search while employed, and therefore, are the least likely to face severe dislocation problems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This article links the literature on family decision making and the economics of job search by examining job search by an unemployed individual within a household context. A theoretical model was developed which demonstrates the interdependence of the utility of household members when one is searching for work. The costs of search are borne by all household members while the benefits are captured in the searcher's expected future wage. A reservation wage was shown to be determined by household financing options, and the perception of relevant labor market parameters. An empirical model of the reservation wage for a sample of unemployment insurance recipients was estimated using two-stage least squares. Results, reported for male and female subgroups, support the hypotheses derived from the household job search model. In particular, the reservation wage was shown to depend on unemployment duration, labor market conditions, increased labor force participation of other household members, use of household assets to finance search, existence of dependents, and unemployment insurance benefits.",

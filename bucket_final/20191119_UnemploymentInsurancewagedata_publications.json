        "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn this study, I used data from California to estimate the returns to a community college education that does not result in a postsecondary credential. I found strong, positive returns to completed credits in career and technical education (CTE) fields that are closely linked to employment sectors that are not credential-intensive (sectors in which employment often does not require a college degree), such as public safety, skilled blue-collar trade and technical work, and accounting and bookkeeping, among others. In these sectors, students were able to convert the human capital acquired in their coursework into returns that far exceeded the cost of the coursework itself, making some noncompleting educational pathways a rational means of securing earnings gains. This finding is consistent with emerging research on skills-builder students and other segments of the community college student population who exhibit coherent patterns of course taking and enrollment that typically do not result in a post...",

Using administrative data from the University System of Georgia, I investigate the effects of recent consolidations on educational quality and efficiency. Comparing cohorts matriculating after consolidations to similar cohorts at non-consolidated institutions reveals that consolidation increases retention rates and the fraction of students graduating on-time with four-year degrees. Spending data and conversations with USG administrators suggest that increased spending on academic support (advising), made possible by economies of scale in student services, are likely responsible for the gains.",

We show that a large percentage of divorced adults with children file tax returns. Moreover, many receive the EITC benefit through the tax system, which results in substantial additional resources for the household. We find little evidence of divorced parents engaging in strategic allocations of their children to maximize EITC claims. We also find that many EITC-eligible low-income parents fail to claim it. A potentially cost-effective way to increase the resources available to low-income working families is to provide easy-to-understand information on child-related provisions in the tax code at the time the court order is established.",

However, concerns have been raised regarding whether this strategy accomplishes its intention or instead reinforces stratification by channelling under-represented students into short-term programmes with questionable value. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of stackable credentials as they were implemented by a consortium of community colleges in the United States that were part of the Health Professions Pathway (H2P) initiative. The results show that many students who completed short or very short programmes went on to earn longer credentials or maintained their enrollment, but there were noticeable racial disparities in the credentials students earned. Additionally, many of the short-term credentials had limit...",

This study analyzed administrative data for 1943 recently emancipated youths who were the parent of at least one child. Like prior studies of former foster youths, this study finds that only half of the parents were employed at any point during the first four quarters after exiting care, most of those who worked were not consistently employed, and the earnings of parents who were employed were very low. Several demographic and placement history characteristics were associated with an increase or decrease in the odds of being employed and/or with total earnings among the parents who worked. The implications of these findings for policy and practice are discussed.",

Our empirical analyses used piecewise exponential survival models to estimate the risk of CPS involvement (investigation or substantiation) as a function of a home foreclosure filing and a set of individual and household characteristics. We fitted these models with and without the inclusion of propensity score weights.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHouseholds that experienced a foreclosure filing had a much higher probability of CPS involvement. This was true in the year before the filing as well as the year after the foreclosure filing. However, these associations were generally largest in the period before or shortly afterward.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExperiencing a foreclosure filing is associated with increased CPS involvement. However, it is not clear that this association is driven by the foreclosure filing action itself. Rather, increased risk of CPS involvement is apparent during the process of moving toward the filing as well as the year or so after the filing, both of which are likely characterized by limited economic resources as well as by financial and other stress.",

Findings from this study confirm those from earlier work: The returns to certificates and diplomas were weak, but associate and bachelor's degrees yielded very strong returns; even small accumulations of credits had labor market value; and the health sector credentials had extremely high returns. Returns were higher for female than for male students. Despite the Great Recession, the returns to college remain strong over the late 2000s.",

In response, child welfare agencies have developed different policies and practices to help monitor, support, and advocate for foster children's educational needs. An important example of these efforts is tutoring programs for children in foster care. The current study uses random assignment to evaluate the impact of an individualized, home-based tutoring program on the academic performance and educational outcomes of a group of adolescent foster youth in Los Angeles County, CA. Data were collected via multi-wave, in-person interviews of 465 foster youth. No statistically significant impacts are found on any included measures of academic ability or other educational outcomes. Substantial proportions of both control and program groups report receipt of tutoring from school, which may partly account for the finding of no effect.",

        "abstract": "In this article we survey the field of policy analysis from two perspectives. First, we discuss recent arguments made for and against the use of random assignment in social experimentation and policy analysis. Second, we argue that data, not methods, are driving policy analysis innovation. We review the benefits and drawbacks of three types of dataâ€”administrative data, spatial data, and Big Dataâ€”and discuss the role, or potential role, each plays in extant policy analysis. We end with a comment on what we believe are the future directions and areas of growth for the field of policy analysis in coming years.",

        "abstract": "This paper combined data collected from war time government records with survey data including background characteristics, such as factors that affected eligibility, to examine the adult depression outcomes of individuals who were evacuated from Finland to temporary foster care in Sweden during World War II. Using war time government records and survey data for a random sample of 723 exposed individuals and 1321 matched unexposed individuals, the authors conducted least squares adjusted means comparison to examine the association between evacuation and adult depression (Beck Depression Inventory). The random sample was representative for the whole population of evacuees who returned to their biological families after World War II. The authors found no statistically significant difference in depressive symptoms during late adulthood between the two groups; for example, the exposed group had a 0.41 percentage points lower average Beck Depression Inventory score than the unexposed group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.907). This study provides no support for family disruption during early childhood because of the onset of sudden shocks elevating depressive symptoms during late adulthood.",

        "abstract": "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been considered a complementary model for biomedical studies, especially due to advantages such as external and rapid development, and genetic manipulation. There is growing interest in this model in neuroscience research since the species has morphological and physiological similarities to mammals and a complex behavioral repertoire. The purinergic signaling has been described in zebrafish, and purinoceptors and nucleotide- and nucleoside-metabolizing enzymes have already been identified in the central nervous system (CNS) of this species. The involvement of the purinergic system in several models of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism has been investigated in zebrafish. This mini review presents several studies describing purinergic signaling in the zebrafish CNS and the action of this neurotransmitter system in models of neurological disorders using this species as a biological model. The use of pharmacological approaches at different stages of development may be a useful tool for preclinical assays and the testing of purinergic compounds as new alternatives for the treatment of neurological disorders.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to reveal the relationship between life activities and cognitive function and to evaluate the interaction between education and various leisure activities in predicting cognitive function. Using a cross-sectional research design with retrospective data, a total of 210 healthy Korean older adults participated and reported their years of education, working, and lifelong leisure activities. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that education was positively associated with cognitive function, whereas working activity was not. Craft activities positively predicted cognitive function. Furthermore, education moderated the relationship between leisure activities and cognitive function. Only low-educated participants showed a decrease in cognitive function as they performed domestic chores and an increase in cognitive function as they participated in social activities and volunteering. High-educated participants showed no relation between leisure activities and cognitive function. The results of the current study suggest that the relationship between various leisure activities and cognitive function can vary based on the nature of the leisure activity and educational level. Professionals examining older adults' cognitive function should pay closer attention to educational level, as well as life styles (i.e. leisure activities), to provide appropriate interventions.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an established cardiovascular risk factor. Here, we investigated its role in cognitive impairment.MethodsBaseline data from 202 participants (aged 65 to 87 years) of the BioCog study were used. All were free of clinical dementia (MMSE≥24/30). Cognitive impairment was defined as the lowest tertile of a cognitive summary score. Multiple logistic regression analyses examined associations of body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), glucose and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels with the odds of cognitive impairment. MetS was defined as ≥3 of its 5 components obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), elevated TG (TG ≥1.7 mmol/L), reduced HDL-C (males: < 1.0 mmol/L; females: < 1.3 mmol/L), elevated glucose (glucose ≥5.5 mmol/L and/or diagnosed diabetes) and elevated blood pressure (history of hypertension). Analyses controlled for age, sex and smoking history.ResultsLower HDL-C was significantly associated with a higher odds of cognitive impairment (OR 2.70 per 1 mmol/L reduction; 95% CI 1.25, 5.56; p = 0.011), whereas BMI, TG, glucose and HbA1c were not (all p > 0.05). Results for HDL-C were similar when HDL-C, glucose, BMI and TG were entered into a single model (OR 2.56 per 1 mmol/L reduction, 95% CI 1.09, 5.88, p = 0.031) and when cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease were additionally controlled for (OR 2.56 per 1 mmol/L reduction, 95% CI 1.06, 6.25, p = 0.036). Among the 5 MetS components, participants with elevated TG were at 2-fold increased odds of impairment (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.08, 4.05, p = 0.028) including when the remaining 4 MetS components were entered (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.07, 4.65, p = 0.033), but the finding was no longer statistically significant when cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease were additionally controlled for (p = 0.11). Presence of MetS and of obesity, reduced HDL-C, elevated glucose or elevated blood pressure were not significantly associated with impairment (all p > 0.05).ConclusionOur findings support low HDL-C as an independent risk marker of cognitive impairment in older age. The need for research into mediatory and confounding factors, and re-evaluation of traditional cut-off points is highlighted.Trial registrationThe study was registered on 15th October 2014 at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02265263).",

        "abstract": "BackgroundPrediabetes is a well-established risk factor for progression to overt diabetes mellitus (DM), which is in turn associated with development of hypertension (HTN) and vice versa. However, the role of prediabetes and HbA1c in particular as an independent risk factor for the development of hypertension is unclear.AimIn this current study, we aimed to evaluate the association between both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in the prediabetes range and development of HTN among a large cohort of normotensive subjects.Design and methodsWe investigated 5016 normotensive participants without DM and other cardiovascular risk factors who were annually screened in a tertiary medical center. Subjects were divided into normoglycemic and prediabetic groups. Normoglycemia was defined as HbA1c < 5.7% and FPG < 100 mg/dl. Prediabetes was defined according to the ADA criteria, i.e., 6.5% > HbA1c ≥ 5.7% or impaired fasting glucose (IFG):126 mg/dl > FPG ≥ 100 mg/dl. Subgroup analysis was made by dividing participants into four groups according to FPG and HbA1C levels, i.e., normoglycemia, impaired HbA1c only, IFG only, and both parameters impaired.ResultsDuring a follow-up of 3.7 ± 2.9 years, 318 (6.3%) subjects developed HTN. A cumulative hazard function for the development of hypertension showed a 2.89-fold ([95% CI 2.19–3.83], p < .0001) increased risk for HTN in the prediabetic population. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusted to common confounding risk factors for HTN, prediabetes was found to be independently associated with a 1.95-fold ([95%, CI 1.43–2.52] p < .0001) increased risk for hypertension. Impaired HbA1C only was not found to be independently associated with HTN, while IFG only showed a 2.13-fold (95%, [CI 1.46–3.11] p < .0001) increased risk for HTN compared to normoglycemic, and a 2.55-fold ([95% CI 1.85–3.51] p < .0001) increased risk for HTN when both parameters impaired.ConclusionOur study demonstrates that FPG in the prediabetes range, albeit not glycated hemoglobin, is independently and significantly associated with future development of HTN. Therefore, our findings further highlight the pivotal predictive role of IFG for HTN development as opposed to the limited independent role of abnormal HbA1c levels.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundOlder people with a low social position are at higher risk of poor health outcomes compared to those with a higher social position. Whether lower social position also increases the risk of geriatric syndromes (GSs) remains to be determined. This study investigates the association of social position with GSs among older community-dwellers.MethodsThree consecutive population-based health surveys in 2006, 2010 and 2014 among older community-dwellers (age 65–84 years) in Stockholm County were combined (n = 17,612) and linked with Swedish administrative registry information. Social position was assessed using registry information (i.e. education, country of origin and civil status) and by self-reports (i.e. type of housing and financial stress). GSs were assessed by self-reports of the following conditions: insomnia, urinary incontinence, functional decline, falls, depressive disorder, hearing or vision problems. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between social position and GSs after adjusting for age, sex, health status, health behavior and social stress.ResultsThe prevalence of GSs was 70.0%, but varied across GSs and ranged from 1.9% for depression to 39.1% for insomnia. Living in rented accommodation, being born outside the Nordic countries, being widowed or divorced were associated with GS presence. Financial stress was most strongly associated with GSs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.59; 95% CI, 2.13–3.15).ConclusionGSs are highly prevalent among older Swedish community-dwellers with wide variations across syndromes and strong association with all measures of social position, most strikingly that of experiencing financial stress.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective/Background Adolescents who experience sleep problems are less able to resist impulses, and youths who show more impulsive behaviors are, in turn, assumed to have more sleep problems, which sets the stage for a negative cycle over time. Empirical research has shown some evidence that sleep problems affect impulse control, but the bidirectional link has previously not been tested. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test this assumption. Methods We used cross-lagged models to investigate the bidirectional association between sleep problems (i.e., insomnia and sleep duration) and impulsive behaviors over two years in a cohort of young adolescents (n=2767, mean age ∼13.7, 47.6% girls). We also investigated the moderating role of age and gender. Results The results showed that the links between sleep duration/insomnia and impulsive behavior are bidirectional. Youths who experienced sleep problems also experienced increased difficulties with impulse control, and problems regulating impulses were also linked with increases in sleep problems, and these effects were systematic over two years. Moreover, age did not moderate these associations but impulsive behaviors had a larger impact on girls’ insomnia as compared to boys. Conclusions By confirming the bi-directionality of this association, this study supports the importance of developing interventions to promote sleep health in adolescents but also the need to tailor such programs to adolescents’ development because adolescents might not be able to prioritize sleep if they cannot control their impulses.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious studies have reported the associations of frailty phenotype or its components with mortality. However, studies that explored the effects of transition in frailty status on mortality were far less in Asian or Chinese. The aim of this study was to evaluate baseline frailty status and one-year change of frailty status in relation to all-cause mortality in Taiwanese community-dwelling older adults who participated in the Taichung Community Health Study for Elders.MethodsWe conducted a community-based prospective cohort study. A total of 921 community-dwelling elderly men and women aged 65–99 years in Taichung City were enrolled in 2009–2010 and were followed up through 2016. We adopted the definition of frailty proposed by Fried et al., including five components: shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low physical activity. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for frailty at baseline and one-year change in frailty status.ResultsThere were 160 deaths during the follow-up period. The mortality rates in groups of robust and frail were 20.26 and 84.66 per 1000 person-years respectively. After multivariate adjustment, the HR (CIs) for baseline frailty was 2.67 (1.73–4.12). Poor endurance and energy [1.88 (1.03–3.42)], slowness [2.60 (1.76–3.83)] and weakness [1.65 (1.16–2.33)] were found to be predictors of mortality. Increased risks in mortality for subgroups of robust-to-frail [2.76 (1.22–6.27)], frail-to-robust [3.87 (1.63, 9.19)], and frail-to-frail [4.08 (1.92–8.66)] over one-year period were observed compared with those remaining robust.ConclusionBaseline frailty status and one-year change in frailty status are associated with 6-year all-cause mortality among Taiwanese elderly adults. Frailty may be useful for identifying older adults at high risks for mortality prevention.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThere is controversy regarding the effect of napping on cardiovascular disease (CVD), with most studies failing to consider napping frequency. We aimed to assess the relationship of napping frequency and average nap duration with fatal and non-fatal CVD events.\n\n\nMETHODS\n3462 subjects of a Swiss population based cohort with no previous history of CVD reported their nap frequency and daily nap duration over a week, and were followed over 5.3 years. Fatal and non-fatal CVD events were adjudicated. Cox regressions were performed to obtain HRs adjusted for major cardiovascular risk factors and excessive daytime sleepiness or obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\n\nRESULTS\n155 fatal and non-fatal events occurred. We observed a significantly lower risk for subjects napping 1-2 times weekly for developing a CVD event (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95) compared with non-napping subjects, in unadjusted as well as adjusted models. The increased HR (1.67, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.55) for subjects napping 6-7 times weekly disappeared in adjusted models (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.38). Neither obstructive sleep apnoea nor excessive daytime sleepiness modified this lower risk. No association was found between nap duration and CVD events.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSubjects who nap once or twice per week have a lower risk of incident CVD events, while no association was found for more frequent napping or napping duration. Nap frequency may help explain the discrepant findings regarding the association between napping and CVD events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nMalnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundB vitamins in the one-carbon metabolism pathway (folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12) have been implicated in DNA methylation, and their deficiency may contribute to cognitive decline through increased homocysteine (Hcy) levels and subsequent oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to investigate whether B vitamin deficiency and increased Hcy could interact with DNA methylation of oxidative-related genes and exacerbate cognitive impairment.MethodsParticipants were selected from a large cohort study entitled the Effects and Mechanism Investigation of Cholesterol and Oxysterol on Alzheimer’s disease (EMCOA) study. We included 2533 participants who completed a selection of comprehensive cognitive tests and a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and were followed for an average of 2.3 years. The longitudinal effects of B vitamin intake on cognitive decline were examined using linear mixed-effect models. Seven mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, in the predementia stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and fivev healthy controls were selected for the discovery of genome-wide differentially methylated CpG sites. Candidate oxidative stress-related genes significantly correlated with serum levels of B vitamins were selected for validation in 102 MCI patients and 68 controls. The correlations between DNA methylation levels and serum concentrations of B vitamins and oxidative biomarkers were analyzed with Spearman’s correlation. The interactive effects of DNA methylation and B vitamins on cognitive performance were further evaluated by multiple linear regression.ResultsIn the prospective analysis, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B12 was significantly associated with accelerated cognitive decline, whereas adequate folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 intakes were significantly associated with better cognitive reserve. In the case-control analysis, the DNA methylation levels of NUDT15 and TXNRD1 were examined, and significantly hypermethylated sites were identified in MCI patients. Significant correlations of hypermethylated sites with serum levels of folate, homocysteine (Hcy), and oxidative biomarkers were observed, and interactive effects of B vitamins and hypermethylated sites were significantly associated with cognitive performance.ConclusionAdequate dietary folate at baseline predicted a better cognitive reserve, while decreased serum levels of B vitamins may contribute to cognitive impairment by affecting methylation levels of specific redox-related genes.Trial registrationEMCOA, ChiCTR-OOC-17011882, Registered 5th, July 2017-Retrospectively registered, http://www.medresman.org/uc/project/projectedit.aspx?proj=2610Graphical Abstract",

        "abstract": "Introduction\nWe investigated the relationship of plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) with cerebral deposition of Aβ and tau on positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n\nMethods\nForty-four participants (18 cognitively normal older adults [CN], 10 mild cognitive impairment, 16 Alzheimer's disease [AD]) underwent amyloid PET and a blood draw. Free and total plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 were assessed using a validated assay. Thirty-seven participants (17 CN, 8 mild cognitive impairment, 12 AD) also underwent a [18F]flortaucipir scan. Scans were preprocessed by standard techniques, and mean global and regional amyloid and tau values were extracted. Free Aβ42/Aβ40 (Aβ F42:F40) and total Aβ42/Aβ40 (Aβ T42:T40) were evaluated for differences by diagnosis and relation to PET Aβ positivity. Relationships between these measures and cerebral Aβ and tau on both regional and voxel-wise basis were also evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nLower Aβ T42:T40 was associated with diagnosis and PET Aβ positivity. Lower plasma Aβ T42:T40 ratios predicted cerebral Aβ positivity, both across the full sample and in CN only. Finally, lower plasma Aβ T42:T40 ratios were associated with increased cortical Aβ and tau in AD-related regions on both regional and voxel-wise analyses.\n\n\nDiscussion\nPlasma Aβ measures may be useful biomarkers for predicting cerebral Aβ and tau. Additional studies in larger samples are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Study objectivesObstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep-related breathing disorder, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), paralleled by intermittent collapse of the upper airway. EDS may be the symptom of OSAHS per se but may also be due to the alteration of central circadian regulation. Irisin is a putative myokine and has been shown to induce BDNF expression in several sites of the brain. BDNF is a key factor regulating photic entrainment and consequent circadian alignment and adaptation to the environment. Therefore, we hypothesized that EDS accompanying OSAHS is reflected by alteration of irisin/BDNF axis.MethodsCase history, routine laboratory parameters, serum irisin and BDNF levels, polysomnographic measures and Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire (ESS) were performed in a cohort of OSAHS patients (n = 69). Simple and then multiple linear regression was used to evaluate data.ResultsWe found that EDS reflected by the ESS is associated with higher serum irisin and BDNF levels; β: 1.53; CI: 0.35, 6.15; p = 0.012 and β: 0.014; CI: 0.0.005, 0.023; p = 0.02, respectively. Furthermore, influence of irisin and BDNF was significant even if the model accounted for their interaction (p = 0.006 for the terms serum irisin, serum BDNF and their interaction). Furthermore, a concentration-dependent effect of both serum irisin and BDNF was evidenced with respect to their influence on the ESS.ConclusionsThese results suggest that the irisin-BDNF axis influences subjective daytime sleepiness in OSAS patients reflected by the ESS. These results further imply the possible disruption of the circadian regulation in OSAHS. Future interventional studies are needed to confirm this observation.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and due to various physiological and psychological factors the patients are at risk of nutritional insufficiencies. The purpose of this study was to assess the dietary fatty acid intake and its effect on plasma fatty acids in elderly Saudi women and to compare the differences in their food and plasma fatty acid profile on the basis of their residence.MethodsA total of 76 elderly women (50–100 years) were recruited through a random sampling method. A structured proforma was designed to gather information related to their age, income, dietary habits, and presence of any disease and awareness of AD. A 24-h dietary recall method for 3 days and food frequency questionnaire, concentrating on fish consumption and consumption of foods rich in ω-3 fatty acids, which was planned by dietitians, was used for dietary assessment. The gathered data were then analyzed using food processor software. The blood samples were collected to determine plasma fatty acids.ResultsThe mean age of women diagnosed with AD was more than 75 years, and the prevalence of illiteracy was higher among AD subjects. As compared to the AD group, the concentration of LA and total ω-6 was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in the control group from both recruitment sites [National Guard Health Affairs, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh (NGH) and Social Welfare Homes for the Elderly (SWH)]. Similarly, the concentrations of EPA, DHA, and ω-3 were also slightly higher in the control group at both sites, but the difference between the control and AD subjects was only significant (p ≤ 0.05) in subjects from NGH. We found no significant difference in the ω-6/ ω-3 ratio between groups. Also, no significant difference was found in the mean level of the plasma fatty acid when comparing the control and AD groups. The concentration of DHA in controls only and AA, EPA and ω-6 in both control and AD were significant (although weakly) correlated with their respective dietary intakes. No correlations were found between the intake of 18 C precursors (LA and ALA) and plasma levels of their long chain derivatives (AA, EPA, and DHA). Education, income, overall health status and the concentration of various fatty acids from food was higher and better in subjects from SWH than NGH. The lower plasma level indicates lower impaired systemic availability of several nutrients.ConclusionWe found that dietary intervention might play a role in the prevention of AD.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundSocioeconomic level of residential environment was found to influence cognitive performance. However, individuals from the same place of residence may be affected differently. We aim to investigate for the first time the influence of individual activity space on the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and the risk of dementia.MethodsIn the frame of the Three-City cohort, a French population-based study, we followed longitudinally (12 years) 7009 participants aged over 65. The activity space (i.e., the spatial area through which a person moves daily) was defined using two questions from Lawton’s Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (“Goes shopping independently”,“Travels alone”), and one question about mobility restriction. The survival analysis was performed using a Cox marginal model that takes into account intra-neighborhood correlations and includes a large number of potential confounders.ResultsAmong people with a limited activity space (n = 772, 11%), risk of dementia is increased in subjects living in a deprived area (characterized by high GINI index or low median income) compared to those living in more favored.ConclusionThis study shows that the individual activity space modifies the association between NSES and the risk of dementia providing a more complete picture of residential inequalities. If confirmed in different populations, these findings suggest that people with limited activity space and living in a deprived neighborhood are particularly at risk and should be targeted for prevention.",

The current study investigated the abilities of plasma Aβ42 and total-tau (t-tau) levels in predicting cognitive decline in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma Aβ42 and t-tau levels were quantified in 22 participants with amnestic MCI through immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay at baseline. The cognitive performance of participants was measured through neuropsychological tests at baseline and annual follow-up (average follow-up period of 1.5 years). The predictive value of plasma Aβ42 and t-tau for cognitive status was evaluated. We found that higher levels of Aβ42 and t-tau are associated with lower episodic verbal memory performance at baseline and cognitive decline over the course of follow-up. While Aβ42 or t-tau alone had moderate-to-high discriminatory value in the identification of future cognitive decline, the product of Aβ42 and t-tau offered greater differential value. These preliminary results might suggest that high levels of plasma Aβ42 and t-tau in amnestic MCI are associated with later cognitive decline. A further replication with a larger sample over a longer time period to validate and determine their long-term predictive value is warranted.",

        "abstract": "This study examined three types of leisure activities (playing cards/mahjong, watching TV/listening to the radio, and participation in social activities) among the older segment of the Chinese population, and the effects of these activities in preventing the feelings of loneliness. Data came from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), conducted in 2005, 2008, and 2011. The males, those who were educated, the young-old (aged between 65 and 74 years), urban dwellers, and living in institutions were more likely to participate in all three activities frequently. Frequent or occasional participation in these three activities was negatively associated with feelings of loneliness. The longitudinal study from 2005 to 2011 showed that respondents who frequently played cards/mahjong at baseline were less likely to feel persistent loneliness at the end of the 2011 wave. Instead, frequently watching TV/listening to the radio in 2008 was associated with lower odds in feeling persistent loneliness at the end of 2011. Hence, active participation in playing cards/mahjong and TV/radio entertainment can be effective treatment intervention against persistent loneliness among older Chinese. For the Chinese, a leisure activity steeped in a nation's culture and heritage, such as playing mahjong, may be used as an intervention strategy to prevent and alleviate chronic loneliness among older adults.",

        "abstract": "Late-life depression, as a potential marker of pre-dementia, has seldom been explored by symptom dimension and sex, despite sexual dimorphic differences. This study aimed to examine whether specific depressive dimensions were associated with pre-Alzheimer’s disease dementia (pre-AD), separately for women and men. Data were drawn from 5617 (58% women) community-dwellers aged 65+ recruited in 1999–2000 and followed at 2-year intervals for 12 years. We used Cox proportional hazard models to study associations between time-dependent Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) symptom dimensions (namely somatic, depressed, positive affect, and interpersonal challenge) and pre-AD, defined retrospectively from validated diagnoses established 3.5 (IQR: 3.2–4.0) years onwards. Analyses were performed according to overall depressive symptomatology (DS+: CES-D score ≥ 16) and antidepressant/anxiolytic medication use (AA). Results indicated that in DS+ women only, all four dimensions were significantly associated with pre-AD in the AA- group, in particular somatic item ‘Mind’ and depressed affect items ‘Depressed’ and ‘Blues’. The most depression-specific dimension, depressed affect, was also significantly associated with pre-AD in the DS– AA- women (HR:1.28, 95%CI: 1.12;1.47). In both sexes, in the DS– groups somatic affect was the most robust pre-AD marker, irrespective of treatment (women: HR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.08;1.38; men: HR = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.14;1.48). Our findings highlight sex-specific associations between depressive symptom dimensions and pre-AD, modulated by depressive symptomatology and treatment. Assessment of specific symptom dimensions taking into account overall symptomatology and treatment could help identify and target high-risk AD-dementia profiles for interventions.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nCognitive impairment and frailty are important health determinants, independently associated with increased dementia risk. In this meta-analysis we aimed to quantify the association of the co-occurrence of cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) and physical frailty with incident dementia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used when reporting this review. We performed a systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for relevant articles. Longitudinal studies enrolling individuals with both CIND and physical frailty and reporting dementia incidence were eligible. Pooled estimates were obtained through random effect models and Mantel-Haenszel weighting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOut of3684 articles, five (14302 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. In comparison to participants free from frailty and CIND, the pooled hazard ratio for dementia was 3.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.64-5.56) for isolated CIND, 1.47 (95%CI: 0.89-2.40) for isolated physical frailty, and 5.36 (95%CI: 3.26-8.81) for their co-occurrence.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe co-occurrence of cognitive impairment and physical frailty is a clinical marker of incident dementia.",

        "abstract": "Board games are played by moving game pieces in particular ways on special boards marked with patterns. To clarify the possible roles of board game use in psychosomatic medicine, the present review evaluated studies that investigated the effects of this activity on health education and treatment. A literature search conducted between January 2012 and August 2018 identified 83 relevant articles; 56 (67%) targeted education or training for health-related problems, six (7%) examined basic brain mechanisms, five (6%) evaluated preventative measures for dementia or contributions to healthy aging, and three (4%) assessed social communication or public health policies. The results of several randomized controlled trials indicated that the playing of traditional board games (e.g., chess, Go, and Shogi) helps to improve cognitive impairment and depression, and that the playing of newly developed board games is beneficial for behavioral modifications, such as the promotion of healthy eating, smoking cessation, and safe sex. Although the number of studies that have evaluated board game use in terms of mental health remains limited, many studies have provided interesting findings regarding brain function, cognitive effects, and the modification of health-related lifestyle factors.",

        "abstract": "Oleic acid (OA) is released from brain phospholipids after cerebral ischaemia; however, its role in ischaemic injury remains unknown. We hypothesised that OA has neuroprotective effects after cerebral ischaemia, which may be exerted through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) activation, since OA is an endogenous ligand of PPAR-γ. The effects of OA administration were evaluated in rodent models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), photothrombosis, and four-vessel occlusion (4-VO). We determined the time window of therapeutic opportunity and examined the ability of the PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662 to reverse OA’s protective effects after MCAO. We found that OA administration decreased the MCAO-induced infarct volume and functional deficits, photothrombosis-induced infarct volume, and 4-VO-induced hippocampal neuronal death. Additionally, OA was highly efficacious when administered up to 3 h after MCAO. Pre-treatment with GW9662 abolished the inhibitory effects of OA on the infarct volume and immunoreactivity of key inflammatory mediators in the ischaemic cortex. Our results indicate that OA has neuroprotective effects against transient and permanent focal cerebral ischaemia, as well as global cerebral ischaemia. It may have therapeutic value for the ischaemic stroke treatment with a clinically feasible therapeutic window. The OA-mediated neuroprotection might be attributable to its anti-inflammatory actions through PPAR-γ activation.",

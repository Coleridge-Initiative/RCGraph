        "abstract": "Abstract This paper focuses on the impact of the latest welfare reform initiatives, through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant (TANF) and its modification through the Balanced Budget Act of 1.997, on Arizona American Indian families, a group disproportionately affected by poverty and lack of economic opportunity. This paper also contrasts the impact of TANF on American Indian populations living off the reservation with its impact on American Indian families living on reservations. Potential effects on tribal communities are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This study identifies factors affecting the adoption of a direct marketing strategy (DMS) by farmers and its impact on the gross sales of farm operations in the United States. The authors use a double-hurdle model and the 2002 Agricultural Resource Management Survey to evaluate empirically the adoption of a DMS and its impact on gross sales of farm operations managed by American farmers. Results suggest that production of organic crops and the regional location of the farm positively affect adoption of a DMS. Adoption of DMS, however, has a negative relation to large farms, farms with production contracts, and farms specializing in cash grains. Farms adopting a DMS are typically those with organic crops and those located in regions with access to a large metropolitan customer base. Our results show that farmers who have adopted a DMS continue to capture a larger proportion of the consumers' dollar increase gross sales than those who have not adopted a DMS.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Our objective was to characterize dairy farming strategies in Pennsylvania to provide baseline data for modeling and assessing economic and environmental impacts of the industry. Material and Methods The USDAâ€™s Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data were used to characterize management practices for 5 dairy farm strategies and 4 herd size categories. Production strategies were confinement, semi-confinement, organic, management intensive rotational grazing, and Amish (use of draft animals with no use of electricity or mobile, powered equipment). Results and Discussion Cattle breed and homegrown and purchased feed type and quantity differed significantly among the 5 strategies, whereas housing and manure management varied with herd size. Solid manure handling was used on 41% of farms, consistent with small herd sizes and wide use of tiestall housing (34% of farms). Confinement dairy farms maintained more cows with greater milk production per cow and had more crop area per cow with less reliance on purchased feeds than the weighted average dairy farm. These farms received the lowest net return per unit of milk, which is consistent with a reduction in the number of small confinement farms from the year 2000 to 2010. Although organic dairy producers had 37% greater variable costs, primarily from the high cost of organic feeds, these farms received the greatest return per unit of milk sold through a 51% greater milk price received. Implications and Applications Management practices found on Pennsylvania dairy farms around the year 2010 are documented to support further assessment of production practices and sustainability of the industry.",

        "abstract": "Feedstock supply risk is one of the key concerns limiting cellulosic biofuel expansion. We use an economic model of corn stover-based ethanol production to investigate strategies to manage stover supply uncertainty, including three contract arrangements that vary according to risk-sharing between the processor and farmers. Applying this model to corn stover-based ethanol in the USA, we find that a greater quantity of biofuel is supplied at lower cost under right-of-access contracts than a delivered quantity contract. The processor can manage some of the risk borne under the right-of-access contracts by contracting excess acreage and, if available, by purchasing deficit stover from a spot market. Contracting excess acreage increases the expected biofuel cost but results in lower uncertainty surrounding cellulosic biofuel supply. A biomass spot market provides a source of biomass during low yielding years, but can also create competition for the processor as an alternative outlet for farmers to supply stover under favorable spot market prices. In general, farmersâ€™ contract preferences are responsive to the basic structure of incentives, which could provide flexibility to processors as the industry develops and market uncertainties change.",

        "abstract": "Contracts between farmers and intermediaries and crop insurers are important means for farmers to mitigate risks in modern U.S. agriculture. In this paper, we investigate the effect of crop insurance enrollment on contract terms and farmersâ€™ participation in marketing contracts. Following Ligon (2003), we set up a mechanism design framework to demonstrate an intermediary's contract design problem, where farmers are assumed to be utility maximizing agents. We depict farmersâ€™ optimal choices of insurance coverage using the specification developed by Babcock (2012). Our model shows that improved terms of crop insurance (lower premiums, higher subsidies) make contracts less appealing to farmers as mechanisms for mitigating risk. Therefore, intermediaries may revise their contract offers so that they are more attractive. However, improvements in contract terms are limited by their cost to the intermediaries and will not lead to expanded participation in contracts.",

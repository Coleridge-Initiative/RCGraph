        "abstract": "Foster children are at disproportionate risk of adverse outcomes throughout the life course. Public policy prioritizes permanency (exiting foster care through reunification with birth parents, adoption, or legal guardianship) to promote foster youths’ healthy development and well-being, but little empirical evidence indicates that permanency, including its most preferred form—reunification—promotes positive outcomes. Using multi-system, statewide longitudinal administrative data, we employed logistic and mixed-effects regression to examine educational attainment and earnings among former foster youth in early adulthood. We found that youth who aged out of care had significantly higher odds of graduating high school and enrolling in college than did reunified youth and youth who exited to guardianship, and they had similar odds as adopted youth. Earnings were similar across groups. Among aged-out (but not reunified) youth, odds of high school graduation and average earnings were higher for youth who spent ...",

        "abstract": "This article is the fourth in a series to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the ILR Review. The series features articles that analyze the state of research and future directions for important themes this journal has featured over many years of publication. Starting with Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data from 2008 to 2013, the authors link administrative data from Social Security and five large means-tested transfersâ€”Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), public assistance (PA), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and housing assistanceâ€”to minimize errors within the SIPP data. Social Security cuts the poverty rate by a thirdâ€”more than twice the combined effect of the five means-tested transfers. Among means-tested transfers, the EITC and SNAP have the largest effects. All programs except for the EITC sharply reduce deep poverty. The relative importance of these programs differs by family subgroup. SSI, PA, and housing assistance have the highest share of benefits going to the pre-transfer poor, whereas the EITC has the lowest. Finally, the SIPP survey data alone provide fairly accurate estimates for the overall population at the poverty line, though they understate the effects of Social Security, SNAP, and PA. Differences in effects are striking, however, at other income cutoffs and for specific family types.",

Using data from Detroit’s welfare-to-work program and the Chernozhukov-Hansen instrumental variables quantile regression method, we find that neither direct-hire nor temporary-help job placements significantly affect the lower tail of the earnings distribution. In the upper tail, direct-hire placements yield sizable earnings increases for over half of participants, while temporary-help placements yield significant earnings losses at higher quantiles. Our results cast doubt on the efficacy of employment programs’ exclusive focus on rapid job placement and their widespread reliance on temporary-help placements.",

        "abstract": "Dual-system families, those involved with the child welfare system and receiving public cash assistance, may be more vulnerable than families only connected to either of the two systems. This study advances our understanding of the heterogeneous and dynamic cash assistance histories of dual-system families in the post-welfare reform era. With merged administrative data from [state name removed] over the period 1998 to 2009, we use cluster analysis to group month-to-month sequences of cash assistance use among households over the 37-month period surrounding child removal. Close to two thirds of families who received any assistance either had a short spell of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or lost TANF. Smaller percentages had steady support. Families who lose assistance are less likely than average to reunify while those who connect to benefits are more likely, suggesting coordination between systems may serve dual-system families well.",

        "abstract": "Child support is a critical source of income, especially for the growing proportion of children born to unmarried mothers. Current social policy supports custodial parent employment (e.g., the Earned Income Tax Credit [EITC] and other work supports have largely taken the place of an entitlement to cash assistance for single mothers of young children). Given many single mothers' limited earnings potential, child support from noncustodial fathers is also important. This raises questions about the effects of child support on custodial mothers' labor supply, and whether policies that increase child support receipt will thereby discourage mothers' employment. This paper addresses these questions, taking advantage of data from a statewide randomized experiment conducted in Wisconsin. Unlike previous nonexperimental research, we do not find any negative effect of child support on the likelihood to work for pay or the number of hours worked in a given week. Recent U.S. social welfare policies have focused on increasing both custodial mothers' child support collections and their labor supply. The results suggest that these may be compatible policies; the absence of a negative labor supply effect strengthens the potential antipoverty effectiveness of child support.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe proportion of low-income single mothers who are disconnected, or not receiving public cash assistance or employment earnings, has increased since the 1996 US welfare reform legislation. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Welfare Rules Database, we use multilevel and multinomial logit models to examine the relationship between state welfare rules and the risk of disconnection. We find that women in states with lifetime limits of less than 60 months are more likely to be disconnected. More generous welfare benefits are associated with a lesser risk of disconnection, while diversion programs are associated with a greater risk of disconnection compared to welfare receipt but are not significant in comparison to employment. Our findings indicate that state rules matter and should be considered as a potential mechanism to change the dynamics of economic disconnection.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to measure the relative contribution of adverse experiences to adolescent behavioral health problems using administrative data. Specifically, we sought to understand the predictive value of adverse experiences on the presence of mental health and substance abuse problems for youth receiving publicly funded social and health services. Medicaid claims and other service records were analyzed for 125,123 youth age 12-17 and their biological parents. Measures from administrative records reflected presence of parental domestic violence, mental illness, substance abuse, criminal justice involvement, child abuse and/or neglect, homelessness, and death of a biological parent. Mental health and substance abuse status of adolescents were analyzed as functions of adverse experiences and other youth characteristics using logistic regression. In multivariate analyses, all predictors except parental domestic violence were statistically significant for substance abuse; parental death, parental mental illness, child abuse or neglect and homelessness were statistically significant for mental illness. Odds ratios for child abuse/neglect were particularly high in both models. The ability to identify risks during childhood using administrative data suggests the potential to target prevention and early intervention efforts for children with specific family risk factors who are at increased risk for developing behavioral health problems during adolescence. This study illustrates the utility of administrative data in understanding adverse experiences on children and the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.",

        "abstract": "Using longitudinal administrative data for Wisconsin, this article accounts for the length of time on welfare and the length of sanctioning to better understand the effect of work-related financial sanctions on cash welfare (TANF) participants' program exits and subsequent employment. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) remains an important, if less generous, part of the safety net for families with children. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the time on welfare, duration of sanctions, and post-welfare employment and earnings outcomes. The results indicate that being sanctioned increases the likelihood of transition off TANF cash assistance and this effect increases with the duration of the sanction. In addition to measuring the effects of welfare sanctions on individual participants, the article also estimates the effects of agency sanction policies, using measures of the risk of sanctions at the agency level. Agency policy effects were of interest both because they addressed the potential effects of changes in the threat of sanctions—even on those not directly subject to them—and because the agency effects were not subject to the same concerns about unobserved individual heterogeneity between sanctioned and non-sanctioned participants. We found that an increase in an agency's use of sanctions resulted in increased exits to no job, to jobs paying less than cash benefits, and to jobs paying more than available cash benefits. Our results have important implications for understanding the consequences of financial sanctions for public program participants.",

        "abstract": "Early welfare reform research showed high rates of employment for TANF leavers. However, work-focused welfare may not be effective during an economic downturn. We investigate the employment of Wisconsin TANF leavers, contrasting outcomes among early leavers (1998) with those who left during the 2001 recession. We use data from administrative records on about 6000 welfare leavers, tracking quarterly employment for 3 years after they left benefits. Separate panel data analyses of those exiting in two different time periods show that individual leavers are less likely to be employed when their local unemployment rate is high in the later cohort; no relationship is found for the early cohort. In a panel analysis in which the cohorts are combined, we find that leavers in the later cohort, who experienced the recession early in their post-welfare career, are less likely to be employed, a result that holds controlling for observed and unobserved characteristics. These findings raise questions about how well single-parent families and their children will fare during difficult economic times now that welfare reform has such a strong emphasis on work.",

Recent research has examined how children in Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program families are faring, with growing interest in the effects upon children of the disruptions to cash benefits that result from program sanctions, the policies that are intended to motivate parents to comply with work requirements. Adding to the body of knowledge on children and TANF sanctions, this study used administrative data to examine school attendance rates and disruptions to enrollment, for children from families with at least one sanction. Findings indicate that there are important probable connections between the factors that contribute to challenges to employment that relate to parenting and the school engagement of children in TANF families.",

Using a Heckman selection model on administrative data from Louisiana's social service office and unemployment insurance wage data (N = 15,816) and controlling for individual and parish characteristics, this study reveals that two work activities, on-the-job training and unsubsidized employment, are associated with an increased probability of employment. Further, unsubsidized employment, on-the-job training, and vocational education are positively associated with earnings, while job search, school attendance, and work experience are negatively associated with earnings.",

        "abstract": "This study identified the employment and earnings trajectories of welfare recipients over six years for a sample of 14,150 women who entered the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF) in Wisconsin in its first year. Wisconsin longitudinal administrative data were used to examine differential patterns of mid-term (three years) and long-term (six years) employment and earnings success. We developed a conceptual approach to categorizing participants' employment and earnings trajectory groups. Results indicate substantial diversity in employment and earnings patterns. Some women have consistently positive outcomes, others show steady improvements over time, and others have inconsistent patterns that end strong. We found that 46% of the sample fit into one of three successful employment trajectories, and 22% fit into one of three successful earnings trajectories. Results also reveal that many women who were successful in the mid-term were not able to sustain their progress. For example, only 56% of those who were earning successes in the mid-term were still successful in the long-term. Final]y, logistic regression models were used to compare the factors associated with mid-term and long-term success and with employment success and earnings success. Implications of findings are discussed. KEY WORDS: employment and earnings; poverty; social policy; TANF; welfare reform ********** Since the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, welfare programs have aimed to move low-income women with children from welfare to work. In the past decade, the number of single-mother families receiving traditional cash assistance (now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF]) has fallen dramatically, and employment rates have risen. However, much of the literature on the economic well-being of welfare recipients and welfare leavers suggests that many who have moved from welfare to work move in and out of the labor market frequently, are working for low wages, and have insufficient earnings to support a family above the poverty line without receiving public means-tested benefits. (For a discussion of post-TANF economic status, see Blank, 2006; Cancian & Meyer, 2004; Danziger, Heflin, Corcoran, Oltmans, & Wang, 2002; Grogger & Karoly, 2005; Johnson & Corcoran, 2003.) Most of the early studies on economic well-being of welfare recipients after welfare reform have examined employment, earnings, and income after leaving cash benefits over fairly short periods of time. Less is known about whether the short-term economic success (or lack of success) has persisted in the long-term. In this article, we use longitudinal administrative data to examine the employment and earnings trajectories of welfare recipients over six years for a sample of approximately 17,000 women who entered TANF in Wisconsin in its first year. We propose a method to characterize the six-year patterns of employment and earnings and consider differential patterns of mid-term (three years) and long-term (six years) employment and earnings success. We compare the factors associated with mid-term and long-term success. POLICY CONTEXT This article focuses on TANF participants in Wisconsin. Wisconsin's TANF program, called Wisconsin Works (W-2), was instituted in September 1997. W-2 consists of several \"tiers\" and is structured to mirror the world of employment. Thus, individuals do not receive a cash payment unless they are working in a community service job, are engaged in a work-like activity (W-2 Transitions), or have a child younger than 13 weeks old (caretaker of newborn). In addition, individuals who are the most work-ready can receive a variety of services without receiving cash (case management). Individuals are expected to begin in the tier that corresponds to their level of work-readiness and to progress up the tiers until they no longer need any W-2 services. …",

        "abstract": "In most states, child support paid on behalf of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) participants is used to offset TANF and child support administrative expendituress this policy primarily benefits taxpayers. In contrast, Wisconsin allowed most custodial parents to keep all support paid on their behalf. This policy, which treats welfare and child support as complements, was evaluated through an experimental design. This paper reports the key results of the experimental evaluation, using state administrative data to examine the effects on child support outcomes and governmental cost. We find that when custodial mothers keep all child support paid on their behalf, paternity establishment occurs more quickly, noncustodial fathers are more likely to pay support, and custodial families receive more support. These outcomes are achieved at no significant governmental cost. © 2008 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.",

Potential welfare recipients compare their on and off welfare utility from after-tax income and in-kind benefits via employment or welfare, and choose whether to work. Our null hypothesis, which we reject, is that benefits affect only the decision to work or not, not the hours worked, which will depend on wages. Using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) administrative data from Washington state, we find that employer provided health insurance and child care subsidies significantly raise exit rates of TANF recipients and induce greater work effort. Other work inducing factors include wages and the Earned Income Tax Credit, while increased levels of Medicaid, Food Stamps and the income guarantee increase welfare dependency.",

        "abstract": "This article examines the prevalence of potential barriers to employment using data from a longitudinal study of 1,075 Milwaukee County parents who applied for assistance from Wisconsin's TANF program in 1999. It also examines whether those potential barriers were related to their subsequent employment and earnings. We find that many of these TANF applicants faced significant and often multiple barriers to employment. Moreover, these potential barriers were associated with both a reduction in their likelihood of being employed and lower earnings when they worked. The implications of these findings for welfare policy and practice are discussed. CRITICAL ISSUES IN WELFARE REFORM AND WORK READINESS",

Our estimates rely on the new Census Bureau Quarterly Workforce Indicators database, which provides county-level economic indicators filtered by industry, gender, and age-group. We specify a multinomial choice model to estimate the effects of these local labor market variables on the full set of work–welfare combinations. The results indicate that lower unemployment rates and increased new hires and new hires’ earnings in key industries increase the likelihood that women choose alternatives that include work. African American women and those with fewer years of education respond differently to changing economic conditions. Our results are robust to controls for fixed effects, county-specific time trends, and endogenous migration.",

Although utilization percentages are increasing, we find that among TANF recipients in 1999, 45.7 percent of all households and 34.8 percent of eligible households did not receive the state earned income credit. Moreover, we find that utilization may depend upon TANF requirements and incentives, information resources, and barriers to work and filing of income tax returns. Finally, we investigate whether low utilization is because of little or no benefit from the state earned income credit and find this may be true for some with barriers or less incentive to work under TANF. © 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.",

        "abstract": "The Wisconsin BadgerCare program, which became operational in July 1999, expanded public health insurance eligibility to both parents and children in families with incomes below 185% of the U.S. poverty line (200% for those already enrolled). This eligibility expansion was part of a federal initiative known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Wisconsin was one of only four states that initially expanded coverage to parents of eligible children. In this paper, we attempt to answer the following question: To what extent does a public program with the characteristics of Wisconsin's BadgerCare program reduce the proportion of the low-income adult population without health care coverage? Using a coordinated set of administrative databases, we track three cohorts of mother-only families: those who were receiving cash assistance under the Wisconsin AFDC and TANF programs in September 1995, 1997, and 1999, and who subsequently left welfare. We follow these 19,201 \"welfare leaver\" families on a quarterly basis for up to 25 quarters, from 2 years before they left welfare through the end of 2001, making it possible to use the labor market information and welfare history of the women in analyzing outcomes. We apply multiple methods to address the policy evaluation question, including probit, random effects, and two difference-in-difference strategies, and compare the results across methods. All of our estimates indicate that BadgerCare substantially increased public health care coverage for mother-only families leaving welfare. Our best estimate is that BadgerCare increased the public health care coverage of all adult leavers by about 17-25% points.",

        "abstract": "Under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, families are subject to greater work requirements, and the severity of sanction for noncompliance has increased. Using Wisconsin longitudinal administrative data, the authors performed event history analysis to examine the dynamic patterns of sanctioning and the patterns of benefits following a sanction. They found that very high rates of sanctioning (especially partial sanctions) and multiple sanctions were fairly common but sanction spells were quite short. The most common transition from a sanction was back to full benefit receipt. The authors also examined the factors associated with being sanctioned and the severity of sanctions by comparing a traditional model with an event history model. They found that it is important to estimate a model that takes into account the period of risk. Results confirm that those who may be least able to succeed in the labor market are most likely to be sanctioned. KEY WORDS: event history analysis; poverty; TANF; welfare programs; welfare sanctions ********** The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) ended the federal guarantee of cash assistance for single-parent families with children and replaced the entitlement program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. Work requirements were a key component of the legislation, and sanctions for noncompliance were an important part of the policy design. Under TANF, sanctions have taken on much greater significance, both because fewer families are exempt from work requirements and because the new policy of full family sanctions means that failure to comply with those requirements can result in the loss of the family's entire cash grant (Pavetti & Bloom, 2001; Pavetti, Derr, & Hesketh, 2003), as well as the loss of food stamps and Medicaid (Cherlin et al., 2001; U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO], 2000). The number of people no longer receiving benefits because they have been sanctioned has increased concern about how often sanctions are used, who is at risk of being sanctioned, and the effects of sanctions on welfare recipients. A number of studies have examined the characteristics of sanctioned families, the reasons these families did not meet their participation requirements, and the later consequences to them. Most of these studies did not focus on sanctions but looked more generally at families who had left welfare (\"leavers\"; see Colville, Moore, Smith, & Smucker, 1997; Westra & Routley, 2000) or were conducted under the old AFDC system (Colville et al.; Fraker, Nixon, Losby, Prindle, & Else, 1997; Kornfeld et al., 1999; GAO, 1997). There is less known about the use of sanctions under TANF. Most of the early studies of sanctions were exploratory and descriptive, assessing the characteristics and describing the experiences of sanctioned recipients or sanctioned leavers. Furthermore, much sanction research has measured a sanction as a simple dichotomous variable (sanction, nonsanction) at a particular time. Relatively few studies have examined the severity of sanctions or the timing and duration of sanctions. We used Wisconsin longitudinal administrative data in our study. These data include detailed information on the timing and severity of sanctions, enabling us to examine the dynamic patterns of sanctioning, factors associated with being sanctioned, and the relationship between sanctioning and subsequent outcomes. POLICY CONTEXT States have broad authority and flexibility regarding the design and use of sanctions. The triggers for sanctions and amount of reduction in the grant vary from state to state. There are various types of sanctions tied to work requirements, child support enforcement, and, for teenagers receiving welfare, the requirements to attend school and live with parents. …",

        "abstract": "Objective: The establishment of the Family Violence Option (FVO) in 1997 was met with some controversy, as critics believed waivers from time limit and work requirements would hinder women's ability to leave welfare and find employment. Method: Using administrative and interview data from Maryland, multivariate equations analyze if domestic violence disclosure, administrative documentation, or waiver use had a statistically significant affect on one year employment and welfare use outcomes of individuals. Results: Waiver holders did not differ fromnonvictims, but victims who are not documented received fewer months of welfare and earned less income. Conclusions: Findings do not indicate that FVOwaivers encourage women to stay on welfare longer. However, the poor outcomes of undocumented victims indicate that some individuals may be slipping through the cracks of a well-intentioned policy.",

This article compares child welfare services involvement between 1996 Aid to Families with Dependent Children entrants and 1999 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) applicants in Wisconsin. Results suggest that there is considerable overlap between welfare applicant and child welfare populations, that this overlap has increased significantly since welfare reform, and that, as state TANF caseloads decline, they may be increasingly composed of families that face significant problems in balancing the demands of work and parenting.",

This paper considers conceptual and measurement issues associated with three different indicators of economic well-being: independence from public assistance, having income above the poverty threshold, and freedom from material hardship. Survey and administrative data from a sample of TANF participants illustrate the sensitivity of conclusions to alternative ways of measuring each indicator. Also considered is the extent to which dependence, poverty, and hardship coincide, or capture important differences in outcomes. The principles underlying TANF reforms have implications for appropriate measures of economic well-being, as the empirical importance of these implications demonstrates. © 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the impact of the race of individual clients and of the local racial context on the implementation of sanctions for recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in a Midwestern state. We find that although nonwhites are sanctioned at lower rates than whites overall, nonwhites are sanctioned more compared to whites in each local area. This paradox occurs because nonwhites tend to live in areas with lower sanction rates. Consistent with the literature on race and policy, we find that sanction rates increase as the nonwhite population increases until a threshold is reached where nonwhites gain political power.",

Data from tests administered by substance abuse testing providers were combined with information from Medicaid, Food Stamp, cash assistance and Unemployment Insurance files to examine differences between the two groups. The findings suggest that the procedures employed by the State of Florida did not produce reliable estimates of the level of drug use among TANF beneficiaries. The data did show very small differences in employment, earnings, and use of government services between individuals who tested positively and those who tested negatively for substance abuse. In addition, evidence is presented that suggests that there is very little difference in employment, earnings and use of government services between users of different kinds of drugs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Probability matching software was employed to link AFDC histories for children with birth records, child abuse reporting data, and foster care data. A total of 63,768 children entering AFDC between 1990 and 1995 in 10 California counties were followed to determine subsequent child welfare involvement. Within 5 years of AFDC entry, 27% of children had child abuse referrals, 22% had child abuse investigations, 8% had child welfare cases opened, and 3% were placed in foster care. Although relatively few children transition from welfare to foster care, AFDC child entrants who later experience child welfare events and their mothers are more likely than others to have certain characteristics such as single parent family structure, larger family size, low birthweight, and late or no prenatal care. Total time on aid and the number of spells on aid are positively associated with child welfare events. It will be important to monitor these findings as welfare reform progresses. Administrative data analysis can suggest ways to effectively target services when fiscal limitations prohibit universal support.",

While not able to collect data currently to meet USGS lidar base specification, this is partially due to the fact that the specification was written for linear-mode systems specifically. With little effort on part of the manufacturers of the new lidar systems and the USGS Lidar specifications team, data from these systems could soon serve the 3DEP program and its users. Many of the shortcomings noted in this study have been reported to have been corrected or improved upon in the next generation sensors.",

        "abstract": "The National Map provides geospatial data that support various uses such as resource management, disaster response, and science investigations. To properly support these needs, data themes of the National Map must be regularly updated and spatially integrated as the features on the ground change because of environmental or man-made events. The elevation theme of the National Map is managed through the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP), which is currently (2019) coordinating collection of high resolution (HR) elevation data for the United States over an eight-year period (Sugarbaker et al. 2014). Through this program, lidar point-cloud data are being collected for the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and U.S. territories, with coarser resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar (ifsar) data being collected for the remote areas of Alaska. HR digital elevation models (DEMs) can be generated at 1 and 3 meter resolution from the lidar point-cloud data and are also furnished by 3DEP.This research develops automated methods to update the hydrography and transportation themes of the National Map in a manner that integrates with the HR elevation and image layers. Surface water drainage networks can be extracted from a HR DEM using flow-direction and flow-accumulation modelling, but results of these methods vary depending on environmental conditions and the existence of anthropogenic features that may affect the accuracy of the elevation model, such as vegetative cover, roads, bridges, and other urban structures. Hydrologic conditioning or enforcement of a HR DEM overcome some of these issues and improve flow modelling for drainage network extraction through techniques such as filtering (Passalaqua et al. 2010), filling sinks (Tarboton 1997), cutting channels through embankments at culvert and bridge locations (Poppenga et al. 2012), or burning-in existing streams (Maidment 1996). However, drainage network extraction results can vary substantially with these techniques and the methods generally require some manual intervention and/or tuning of parameters (Poppenga et al. 2013). Consequently, additional work is needed to streamline and further automate such methods for the various landscape conditions within the United States.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Spot elevations published on historical U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps were established as needed to enhance information imparted by the quadrangle’s contours. In addition to a number of other features like road intersections, section corners, lakes and water wells, labels were routinely placed on mountain peaks, local high points, passes and saddles. While some elevations were established through field survey triangulation, many were “dropped” during photogrammetric stereocompilation. The average accuracy, which varied with method, terrain, and map vintage, was on the order of ± 10 feet. Today, inexpensive consumer devices deliver comparable accuracy using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Professional equipment can achieve even better accuracies. These methods have replaced the field- and funding-intensive traditional triangulation methods in the geographic sciences. However, since GPS measurements require visiting the feature location, a national dataset containing high-accuracy spot elevations has not yet been created. Consequently, modern US Topo maps are devoid of mountain peak or other spot elevations. Additionally, no government agency is currently mandated to create one. Still, US Topo map users continue to demand the display of spot heights, particularly mountain peak elevations. As lidar data are collected through the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP), the source for higher accuracy spot heights increases. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of automatically generating elevation values at summits named in the Board on Geographic Name’s Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), using 3DEP data. As the 3DEP incorporates more lidar data, these values should become increasingly more accurate. The first step in the automation process involved “snapping” GNIS summits to the highest and most accurate nearby point (pixel) in the 3DEP one-third arc second seamless dataset (1/3 a-s). Development of this step was completed in a prior study and will be reported elsewhere. In Step 2, a process similar to Step 1 was implemented to identify the highest pixel in the 3DEP one-meter dataset (1-m) from an area defined by a one-pixel buffer around the snapped point pixel. After finding the highest pixel in the 1-m dataset, the same process for Step 2 was repeated on the lidar point cloud dataset (LPC). In the latter case, the highest lidar point within the buffered area was chosen where there were more than one, which was the case in most instances. In the case that the next higher resolution data were unavailable, the summit spot elevation was set to the value obtained from the lower resolution layer. Hence, if 1-m data were unavailable, but LPC data did exist, the program in its current state was unable use the higher resolution data. This is due to the fact that the 1-m data are employed to drive the software to a more precise location of the summit. Without that intermediate step the method fails to identify the correct LPC point. Work in progress is aimed at overcoming this disadvantage, which is particularly important until the time when the 1-m dataset is populated for the entire nation. The National Geospatial Program estimates the completion of lidar acquisition by 2023. Processing from acquisition to update of the 1-m dataset, including quality assessment and revisions, currently requires between two and three years. Resulting elevation values are compared to those published by Peakbagger.com and TOPOZONE.com. Preliminary results from 40 summits indicate that values derived from lidar are generally higher, whereas those populated from the 1/3 arc-second are generally lower. A thorough understanding of these relationships will require the evaluation of more points.",

        "abstract": "Historic lead and zinc (Pb-Zn) mining in southeast Missouri’s “Old Lead Belt” has left large chat piles dominating the landscape where prior to 1972 mining was the major industry of the region. As a result of variable beneficiation methods over the history of mining activity, these piles remain with large quantities of unrecovered Pb and Zn and to a lesser extent cadmium (Cd). Quantifying the residual content of trace metals in chat piles is problematic because of the extensive field effort that must go into collecting elevation points for volumetric analysis. This investigation demonstrates that publicly available lidar point data from the U.S. Geological Survey 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) can be used to effectively calculate chat pile volumes as a method of more accurately estimating the total residual trace metal content in these mining wastes. Five chat piles located in St. Francois County, Missouri, were quantified for residual trace metal content. Utilizing lidar point cloud data collected in 2011 and existing trace metal concentration data obtained during remedial investigations, residual content of these chat piles ranged from 9247 to 88,579 metric tons Pb, 1925 to 52,306 metric tons Zn, and 51 to 1107 metric tons Cd. Development of new beneficiation methods for recovering these constituents from chat piles would need to achieve current Federal soil screening standards. To achieve this for the five chat piles investigated, 42 to 72% of residual Pb would require mitigation to the 1200 mg/kg Federal non-playground standard, 88 to 98% of residual Zn would require mitigation to the Ecological Soil Screening level (ESSL) for plant life, and 70% to 98% of Cd would require mitigation to achieve the ESSL. Achieving these goals through an existing or future beneficiation method(s) would remediate chat to a trace metal concentration level that would support its use as a safe agricultural soil amendment.",

        "abstract": "Close range digital photogrammetry, which involves the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), has been used in a growing number of diverse applications across different scientific disciplines. Our objective was to use the mentioned method in the survey of the contemporary geoecological conditions of the coastal area on the example of Portuguese northwest coastal zone. The coastal zone can be subdivided into two geomorphological sectors: Sector 1, between the Minho River and the town of Espinho, where the coastal segments consist of estuaries, sandy and shingle beaches with rocky outcrops, and Holocene dune systems. The estuaries and the foredunes in particular are very degraded by human activities; and Sector 2, between Espinho and the Mondego Cape, where coastal lagoons and Holocene dune systems occur. We chose two beaches for surveying – Agucadoura and Ramalha to which the drone swinglet CAM took the photos. We used the ground control software eMotion 2 to plan the flights over the study area and controlled the drone’s trajectory during flight. After processing the obtained images in the program of AgisoftPhotoscanPro, we generated the 2D orthophotos and 3D digital elevation models (DEM) of the research sections. At this stage of study we derived the above product without using the ground control points, or we used only the camera GPS data. Based on these models the compilation of the large-scale maps of high resolution (1cm-5cm) will be possible in the GISs for monitoring and management of the geoecological state of the mentioned beaches in case to precise the x, y and z values of the models with the geodetic device of Differential GPSs in the selected ground control points (GCP).",

        "abstract": "Barrier systems around the world are experiencing accelerated sea-level rise, reduced sediment supply, and frequent hurricane impacts. However, detailed quantitative field-based studies concerning the response to these external forcing mechanisms are scarce, particularly on the scale of entire islands. The Mississippi - Alabama barrier island chain, located along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coastline has lost land on the order of hectares per year since records began in the 1840s, putting mainland coastal communities and important ecosystems at risk. Here we present an analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation models, revealing erosional/depositional patterns and geomorphologic changes around the most vulnerable of these islands, Ship Island. Four LiDAR datasets (2004, 2007, 2010, and 2012), capturing the complete topography of the island and some bathymetry in the inlet and surrounding shallows to depths of up to 8 m, are used to investigate subaerial and subaqueous sediment volume changes between these years. The impact of Hurricane Katrina, which produced the highest storm surge ever recorded in the United States, is captured in the 2004-2007 dataset. During this time, sediment comparable to 1.5 times the 2004 subaerial island volume was lost from the area included in the topographic/bathymetric dataset. Only 1/5 of this volume was recovered to this area between 2007 and 2010. The island returned to a state of sediment loss between 2010 and 2012, albeit within the error bounds, while the areal extent of the islands continued to increase. This study examines the impact severe storm events can have on vulnerable barrier islands. It highlights the importance of utilizing 3D datasets that include both topographic and bathymetric data for morphodynamic analyses of barrier island systems.",

        "abstract": "Among the different types of natural disasters, floods are the most devastating, widespread, and frequent. Floods account for approximately 30% of the total loss caused by natural disasters. Accurate flood-risk mapping is critical in reducing such damages by correctly predicting the extent of a flood when coupled with rain and stage gage data, supporting emergency-response planning, developing land use plans and regulations with regard to the construction of structures and infrastructures, and providing damage assessment in both spatial and temporal measurements. The reliability and accuracy of such flood assessment maps is dependent on the quality of the digital elevation model (DEM) in flood conditions. This study investigates the quality of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based DEM for spatial flood assessment mapping and evaluating the extent of a flood event in Princeville, North Carolina during Hurricane Matthew. The challenges and problems of on-demand DEM production during a flooding event were discussed. An accuracy analysis was performed by comparing the water surface extracted from the UAV-derived DEM with the water surface/stage obtained using the nearby US Geologic Survey (USGS) stream gauge station and LiDAR data.",

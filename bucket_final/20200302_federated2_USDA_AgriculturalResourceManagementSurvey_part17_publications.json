Findings \nindicate a negative association between “full-time” off-farm work and off-farm wages among farm operators in both categories \nwho are at the higher portions of their respective off-farm wage distributions, \nwhich is in accordance with the compensating differential prediction.",

        "abstract": "The Internet is a strategic technology because it has found application across virtually all sectors of the economy. The Internet has become an everyday part of rural life and is an important new technology in U.S. agriculture. This study uses information collected through the 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to explore the adoption of computers with Internet access and Internet use by farm households. Results from this study suggest that adoption of computers with Internet access is positively related to age and educational level of the operator, off-farm business income, presence of a spouse, and regional location of the farm. Further, large farms and part-owner farms are more likely to adopt computers with Internet access. Internet use for the farm, household, or both is strongly related to the educational level of the operator and spouse, presence of teenagers in the household, farm size, and regional location of the farm.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The projected increases in World population and need for food have recently motivated adoption of information technology solutions in crop fields within precision agriculture approaches. Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and communication devices, partly or completely buried underground for real-time soil sensing and monitoring, emerge from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless integration of underground sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the complex social network of growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors. In this paper, state-of-the-art communication architectures are reviewed, and underlying sensing technology and communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented. Moreover, recent advances in the theory and applications of wireless underground communication are also reported. Finally, major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified.",

        "abstract": "Crop residue management, provision of animal feed or bedding, and increased income are potential reasons for harvesting corn (Zea mays L.) stover. Reasons for not doing so include the need for crop residue to restore or increase soil organic matter, protect against wind and water erosion, and cycle plant nutrients. Bioenergy market development may increase the number of producers harvesting corn stover. Can farming practice data predict the likelihood for harvesting corn stover at a national scale? Farm operation, technology, and management variables from the 2010 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) of U.S. corn growers were compared between operations that removed corn stover and those that did not. Nationwide, stover was removed from approximately 6.3% of all corn operations, indicating stover harvest was not a common practice in 2010. Factors increasing the likelihood for stover harvest included producing feed corn, managing crop residues for pest control, and farmland ownership. Technology and conservation practice adoption rates were similar in both groups. Excessive stover removal can increase soil degradation. Both groups had erosion control adoption rates of ≤10%, which may provide an additional disincentive to harvest stover. Overall, the evaluated variables were similar between producers that did and did not harvest stover. This assessment provides a 2010 national baseline that can be used for future evaluations as bioenergy and bioproduct markets develop.",

Additionally, financial constraints have an impact on production efficiency and technology adoption. This study investigates factors affecting farmers’ participation in the agri-environmental programs like Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Environmental Quality Incentives Programs (EQIPs) in the U.S. particular attention is given to the roles of liquidity and solvency on participation in CRP and EQIP. Results show that both liquidity and solvency have a negative impact on participation in such programs. Additionally, we found that access to the Internet plays an important role in the farmer's decision to participate in CRP and EQIP. Our results also suggested that beginning farmers are more likely to participate in EQIP program.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss opportunities to obtain more information from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). Specifically, the paper will explore the issue of survey nonresponse, the development of pseudo panels, and more frequent updating of cost of production data on an enterprise basis.\\ Design/methodology/approach - Researchers from the Land Grant University System and the Economic Research Service have relied on ARMS to evaluate the effect of agricultural, macroeconomic, and other factors on the US farm sector, farm businesses, and the households that manage them. This paper will identify gaps in understanding and proposes approaches to extract additional information from ARMS. Findings - The relevance of ARMS in the future will depend on the ability to continue to understand potential pitfalls and areas of additional research that can develop new procedures to extract additional information. Three issues which are in need of further study include continuing to examine the issue of non-response, refining methods to develop pseudo panel data, and examining methods to develop commodity specific financial information between the commodity specific surveys. Originality/value - The National Research Council completed a review of ARMS to address challenges in keeping the survey relevant into the future. However, research that examines the construction of financial statements and other information had not been conducted since the early 1990s. This study fills part of that gap.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) conducted annually by the USDA's Economic Research Service collects data on US agriculture, ranging from production practices to the financial condition of farm and ranch enterprises and the farm household. The purpose of this article is to consider what could make ARMS useful from a farmer's point of view. Design/methodology/approach - A Delphi method is used to gather input from a panel of experts. Findings - Results show that increasing the usability of the ARMS to agricultural producers involves expanding the content and relevance of the data collected. Specific types of data needed are identified. Also, recommendations are made concerning how the usefulness and relevance of the data could be increased by refining the sample frame. Finally, it is argued here that after making some adjustments to the ARMS sample frame to create nationally representative data, the ARMS project could serve as a hugely important basis for reporting economic performance levels for American agriculture. Originality/value - This study offers insights from agricultural finance experts on how the ARMS could be improved to expand the quality and usefulness of its output for both professionals and agricultural producers.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the intertemporal causal relationship between oil prices and welfare programs in Kern County is studied using monthly data between 1999:7 and 2016:8. Results from the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-bounds testing approach show that there is stable long run equilibrium relationship between CalFresh caseloads, oil prices and unemployment. They also show that adjustment in CalFresh participation due to changes in oil prices and unemployment is slow, and a 10% increase in unemployment led to a 3.3% increase in CalFresh enrollment. Results from a modified Granger Causality method indicated causality running from unemployment to CalWORKs, and no causality from oil prices to CalWORKs participation. The GIRF confirmed that CalWORKs is more responsive to changes in unemployment than to oil price shocks. The FEVDC results demonstrated that contributions of the oil price shocks in explaining variations in CalWORKs were negligible.",

        "abstract": "Since the implementation of the 1996 welfare reform act, the child-only Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) caseload has increased dramatically. Perhaps the least understood child-only population is that of ineligible immigrant parents (IIPs), who are ineligible for TANF because of their citizenship or immigration status. Using data collected through in-depth interviews and focus groups in Stanislaus County, California, this study examines how well California's TANF program serves this at-risk group. We analyze the factors that lead IIPs to seek aid for their children, the enrollment obstacles they face, and TANF's ability to meet their needs. Our results demonstrate that immigration-related fears as well as concerns about caseworkers, stigma, and future government sanctions heighten these parents' reluctance to seek aid. They also create multiple and often population-specific barriers to TANF enrollment. We close with research and policy recommendations for serving this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "Welfare-to-work transportation programs are premised on a conceptualization of the spatial mismatch hypothesis that focuses on the physical separation between the central city locations of welfare participants, rapidly expanding job opportunities in the suburbs, and the long commutes needed to connect them. Using data from three diverse California counties, this study examines welfare recipients' spatial access to employment. The study finds that the traditional notion of the spatial mismatch is less relevant to welfare recipients, many of whom live in counties in which the urban structure does not fit the simple model of poor, central-city neighborhoods and distant, job-rich suburbs. Many welfare recipients live in job-rich areas; others live in neighborhoods that are spatially isolated from employment. TO be effective, therefore, transportation policies must be tailored to the diverse characteristics of the neighborhoods in which welfare recipients live.",

        "abstract": "We use a unique data set containing information from state individual income tax returns, Wisconsin unemployment insurance wage data, and data collected by hand from Wisconsin courthouses to examine the earned income tax credit (EITC) usage by divorced men and women with children. We show that a large percentage of divorced adults with children file tax returns. Moreover, many receive the EITC benefit through the tax system, which results in substantial additional resources for the household. We find little evidence of divorced parents engaging in strategic allocations of their children to maximize EITC claims. We also find that many EITC-eligible low-income parents fail to claim it. A potentially cost-effective way to increase the resources available to low-income working families is to provide easy-to-understand information on child-related provisions in the tax code at the time the court order is established.",

        "abstract": "When a parent has another child with a new partner, a significant effect on parents and children is likely, making factors associated with multiple-partner fertility of interest to policy makers. For single mothers, one potential policy-relevant factor influencing their subsequent fertility with a new partner is child support income. However, the direction and magnitude of any effect is not well-established. This study documents the simple negative relationship between child support and nonmarital fertility with a new partner in our sample of low-income unmarried mothers. We then take advantage of a policy experiment that resulted in randomly assigned differences in child support income to investigate its effects. We find no support for a negative causal relationship between child support receipt and nonmarital fertility with a new partner, instead finding suggestive evidence that mothers with more child support income are slightly more likely to have a subsequent nonmarital birth with a new partner.",

        "abstract": "Most families in the child protective services system also interact with the child support enforcement system. This study exploits a natural experiment in Wisconsin, created by the state's large regional variation in child support referral policy, to estimate a potentially important effect of child support enforcement on the duration of out-of-home foster care placement. The effect we examine is whether requiring parents to pay support to offset the costs of foster care delays children's reunification with a parent or other permanent placement. We find evidence of this unintended effect, which is important not only because longer foster care spells are expensive for taxpayers, but also because extended placements in foster care may have consequences for child well-being. Our results highlight the potential importance of cross-systems analysis and the potential consequences when the policies and fundamental objectives of public systems are inconsistently coordinated. We discuss the implications of our findings for child support and child protective services policy.",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesWhile the economic model of crime suggests that improving post-prison labor market prospects should reduce recidivism, evaluations of previous employment-oriented re-entry programs have mixed results, possibly due to the multi-faceted challenges facing prisoners at the time of their release. We present an evaluation of an experiment that combines enhanced employment opportunities with wrap around services before and after release.MethodsThis paper presents what we believe is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a re-entry program that combines post-release subsidized work with “reach-in” social services provided prior to release. The sample was 236 high-risk offenders in Milwaukee with a history of violence or gang involvement.ResultsWe observe increased employment rates and earnings during the period when ex-offenders are eligible for subsidized jobs, and these gains persist throughout the year. The intervention has significant effects (p < 0.01) in reducing the likelihood of rearrest. The likelihood that the treatment group is re-imprisoned during the first year after release is lower than for controls (22 vs. 26 %) but the difference is not statistically significantly different from zero.ConclusionsThe results of our RCT suggest that “reach-in” services to help improve human capital of inmates prior to release, together with wrap around services following release, boosts employment and earnings, although whether there is sufficient impact on recidivism for the intervention to pass a benefit-cost test is more uncertain. Average earnings for both treatment and control groups were very low; legal work simply does not seem that important in the economic lives of released prisoners.",

The Spanish Authority has accordingly posed many efforts and resources towards improving the institutional support for both enterprises and individual citizens. The demand for domain services has increased exponentially in the last few years. This situation has evidenced the need for a modernization process within the Public Entity in charge of domain name management and assignment in Spain (Red.es). In that sense, both IT and business professionals alike analyzed the actual situation and chose the most appropriate strategy to follow in order to be able to overcome the challenges posed in that context. The objectives of the modernization included improving the efficiency of the domain assignment process and minimizing the maintenance costs. To reach this goal, Red.es is applying a modernization process that we present in this work. Such process combines the OMG's proposal of Architecture Driven Modernization and Gap Analysis techniques.",

Drawing on a dataset that contains extensive information on a large and diverse panel of low-income families for up to 5years following voucher receipt, we isolate the effects of voucher receipt using propensity score matching techniques together with regression adjustment. Full-sample results show voucher receipt to have little effect on neighborhood quality in the short-term, but some positive long-term effects. We also find that voucher receipt is tied to a higher probability of change in household composition in the year of voucher receipt, but greater stability in subsequent years. Our large sample allows us to explore differential responses of geographic and socioeconomic subgroups. Our findings have several implications for both research and policy.",

        "abstract": "Only a small fraction of firms that hire disadvantaged workers claim the federal subsidies for which they qualify, namely, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Welfare‐to‐Work Tax Credit (WtW). Subsidy benefits depend partially on job duration, with higher subsidy rates above certain job‐duration thresholds. I estimate the relationship between a firm's WOTC/WtW participation and its eligible workers' job durations. Using unique Wisconsin administrative data, I find that workers' subsidy rates (determined by hours worked) have the expected relationship to participation: Firms with a larger fraction of workers exceeding the programs' job‐duration thresholds are more likely to claim the WOTC/WtW. I also find no evidence that firms systematically modify the job duration of their workers to maximize subsidy payments.",

        "abstract": "The objective of business service analysis is to identify candidate business processes and services, and provide an in-depth understanding of their functionality, scope, reuse, and granularity. Unfortunately, many of today's service analysis and design techniques rely on ad-hoc and experience-based identification of value-creating business services and implicitly assume a \"blue sky\" situation focusing on the development of completely new services while offering very limited support for discovering candidate services from a varied inventory of pre-existing software assets. In this article, we introduce a novel business service engineering methodology that identifies and conceptualizes business services in a business domain. Moreover, our approach takes into account a realistic situation, in which pre-existing enterprise assets must be considered for the reuse to implement fragments of the newly conceived business services. A running example is provided to exemplify our approach.",

        "abstract": "The employment and earnings effects of the state-oriented federal welfare reform legislation of 1996 have been extensively studied using either survey or administrative data. Because information may differ substantially across these sources, it is difficult both to identify the true effects of these interventions and to compare evaluation estimates of these interventions that rely on these different data sources. This paper uses data gathered as part of the Wisconsin Child Support Demonstration Evaluation to examine the extent to which administrative (unemployment insurance) and survey records on employment and earnings for a sample of low-skilled women are congruent. Our findings suggest that there are substantial differences in both mean earnings and mean employment rates between survey and unemployment insurance (UI) data. We identify the extent to which these disparities can be explained by differences between these data sources in the definition of earnings or the method of data collection. We also examine the differences between UI and survey sources in estimates of employment and earnings growth among low-skilled women.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Child support collection policies have become more stringent over time, but the effects of child support payment on parental relationships are poorly understood. This study, utilizing State of Wisconsin administrative and survey data, examines the role of child support in father contact and parental conflict. Findings indicate that child support is associated with a greater likelihood of contact between biological parents. Child support receipt, however, is also associated with higher likelihoods of parental conflict in some cases.",

        "abstract": "This article examines the prevalence of potential barriers to employment using data from a longitudinal study of 1,075 Milwaukee County parents who applied for assistance from Wisconsin's TANF program in 1999. It also examines whether those potential barriers were related to their subsequent employment and earnings. We find that many of these TANF applicants faced significant and often multiple barriers to employment. Moreover, these potential barriers were associated with both a reduction in their likelihood of being employed and lower earnings when they worked. The implications of these findings for welfare policy and practice are discussed. CRITICAL ISSUES IN WELFARE REFORM AND WORK READINESS",

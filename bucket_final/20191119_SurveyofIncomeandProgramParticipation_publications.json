        "abstract": "Abstract This paper analyzes how the legalization of same-sex marriage in the U.S. affected same-sex couples in the labor market by using data from the American Community Survey. Access to marriage led to amendments in tax, health insurance, and adoption laws that could have encouraged some same-sex partners to specialize in household production and decrease their labor supply. Nevertheless, estimates from a difference-in-difference model show that the individual and joint probabilities of being employed increased among same-sex couples. Additional evidence suggests that these changes in employment were driven by improvements in attitudes and lower discrimination against sexual minorities following the introduction of marriage equality.",

        "abstract": "This study uses a matching method to provide an estimate of the nativity wealth gap among older households in Europe. This approach does not require imposing any functional form on wealth and avoids validity-out-of-the-support assumptions; furthermore, it allows estimation not only of the mean of the wealth gap but also of its distribution for the common-support sub-population. The results show that on average there is a positive and significant wealth gap between natives and migrants. However, the average gap may be misleading as the distribution of the gap reveals that immigrant households in the upper part of the wealth distribution are better off, and those in the lower part of the wealth distribution are worse off, than comparable native households. A heterogeneity analysis shows the importance of origin, age at migration, and citizenship status in reducing the gap. Indeed, households who migrated within Europe, those who moved at younger ages rather than as adults, and those who are citizens of the destination country display a wealth gap that is consistently smaller over the entire distribution.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE\nThe six-question disability set from the American Community Survey serves as the national standard for measuring disability across all surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These questions are intended to identify people who experience a long-term disability, and data from these questions are frequently interpreted as capturing discrete groups of individuals. Recent research has shown that a significant proportion of individuals respond to these questions inconsistently over time, possibly indicating that the six-question set also identifies transitory disability. However, it is unclear if these inconsistent responses are associated with changes in health status. We begin to test the validity of these observations by exploring how changes in health related quality of life correspond to changes in disability status.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 525 participants to complete a longitudinal paper and pencil survey four times over 18 months that included the six disability questions, measures of health related quality of life, and mobility equipment use. We computed within person changes in health related quality of life variables to investigate how changes in disability status are associated with changes in health status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong respondents who reported disability, half or less consistently reported the same disability. Additionally, respondents who changed disability responses also reported changes in health related quality of life. For example, when individuals transition into walking disability, their health-related quality of life index decreases by, on average, 0.18 s.d. (p<0.05), and when individuals transition out of walking disability their health-related quality of life index increases by, on average, 0.27 s.d. (p<0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe six-question set identifies people who experience both enduring and transitory disability. Changes in health related characteristics correlate with changes in disability status. This suggests that observed transitions in disability reflect real changes in perceived health and impairment.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe impact of looking after children who live with complex chronic conditions is a growing public health issue. However, it is unclear whether sociodemographic and psychosocial variables can be used to predict the burden on the caregiver and how the profiles of families of children with chronic diseases are defined and structured. The objective of this study was to identify multivariate sociodemographic and psychosocial variables as well as sociocultural and familial factors to analyze the caregiver burden of family caregivers of children with chronic diseases.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted involving 416 family caregivers of children with chronic diseases at the National Institute of Health in Mexico City. The participants responded to a questionnaire on sociodemographic variables and a battery of 7 instruments that examined caregiver burden, family support, parental stress, anxiety, support networks, family functioning, historic-psycho-socio-cultural premises and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index.ResultsA multivariate analysis using hierarchical multiple regression models showed that the variables included in the psychosocial and sociodemographic profile as a whole explained 40% of the variance in caregiver burden, taking sociocultural historical premises, stressors and anxiety into account as positive individual predictors. Negative individual predictors for caregiver burden included upper secondary education, social support networks, family support, family functioning and well-being. The sociodemographic profiles of family caregivers were as follows: female (81.7%); mean age, 31.7 years (standard deviation [SD], 8 years); married (79.3%); nuclear family (60%); basic education (62.7%); unpaid work (66.3%); and a daily household income of approximately 4 USD (61.1%).ConclusionsThe caregiver burden of family caregivers of children with chronic diseases is defined and structured based on personal, family, and sociocultural factors. These features provide evidence to conduct research and implement intervention strategies with regard to families facing adversity, risk and vulnerability during a child’s disease.",

We first provide a general description of the city and compare the geographic distribution of population, income, and race of survey respondents with external data. With this demographic profile in mind, we analyze respondents’ ratings of local safety, availability of green spaces, and quality of local public schools to see if they are consistent with external data sources. In the case of public school quality, where these ratings appear inconsistent, we propose an explanation to resolve this.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper demonstrates how adding nominal wage rigidity to a standard, closed economy sticky price model can by itself create a mechanism by which increases in government spending cause increases in consumption. The increase in output arising from government purchases puts upward pressure on the price level. At a fixed short-run nominal wage, this bids down the real wage, which leads producers to increase labor demand. Increased labor demand allows households to both finance the tax bill associated with the government spending as well as increase their own consumption. Our approach does not rely upon existing ingredients for generating large fiscal multipliers, such as the zero lower bound, borrowing constrained households or an interaction between consumption and government purchases in the utility function.",

        "abstract": "Studies indicate an association between disability and higher rates of household food insecurity (HFI). Geographic variation in this relationship has not been explored despite the potential influence of economic and political contexts, including costs of living and disability social assistance. This study examines the association between mobility impairment and HFI within and across Canada considering the possible role of population composition, contextual, and collective influences. Using data from 217,094 adults from the 2007/08, 2009/10, 2013/14, and 2015/16 Canadian Community Health Survey, multivariate logistic regression models examined associations between mobility impairment and HFI controlling for socio-demographic factors and geography of residence (i.e., province, region, and urban/rural status). Subsequent analysis of 14,353 surveyed adults with mobility impairments was conducted to examine geographic and socio-demographic factors associated with HFI in this population. Adults with mobility impairments had elevated odds of HFI of 3.85 (95% CI: 3.49-4.24), when adjusting for age, sex, and geography of residence and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.89-2.35) adjusting for additional socio-demographic characteristics. Across Canada, mobility impaired adults experienced greater odds of HFI. Significantly lower odds of HFI were found for mobility impaired adults living in Newfoundland, Alberta, and Saskatchewan compared to Ontario when adjusting for age and sex, and in Quebec when controlling for additional socio-demographic factors. Socioeconomic factors and age accounted for most variation in HFI in this population, suggesting the importance of poverty reduction strategies that reduce vulnerability to HFI across the population.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper analyzes how the legalization of same-sex marriage in the U.S. affected same-sex couples in the labor market by using data from the American Community Survey. Access to marriage led to amendments in tax, health insurance, and adoption laws that could have encouraged some same-sex partners to specialize in household production and decrease their labor supply. Nevertheless, estimates from a difference-in-difference model show that the individual and joint probabilities of being employed increased among same-sex couples. Additional evidence suggests that these changes in employment were driven by improvements in attitudes and lower discrimination against sexual minorities following the introduction of marriage equality.",

        "abstract": "Objective\nTo identify associations between modifiable risk factors (cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity) and financial hardship (difficulty paying bills, food insecurity and medication need) among middle-aged and older Americans in a nationally representative sample.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 8212 persons age 50 years and older who completed the core 2010 Health and Retirement Study survey and the psychosocial questionnaire. We ran separate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the association of three modifiable risk factors and three different financial hardship indicators.\n\n\nResults\nAdjusting for all covariates, compared to men of normal weight, men who were obese had a 1.4 greater odds of difficulty paying their bills (95% CI: 1.08-1.76); former smokers had a 1.8 greater odds of being food insecure (95% CI: 1.05-2.95); current smokers were twice as likely to be food insecure (95% CI: 1.21-3.73); Compared to women who never smoked, current smokers had a 1.5 greater odds of having difficulty paying their bills (95% CI: 1.11-2.02); current smokers had a 1.8 greater odds of being food insecure (95% CI: 1.13-2.91); and women who were obese had a 1.5 greater odds of reducing medication due to cost (95% CI: 1.11, 2.02).\n\n\nConclusion\nOur findings contribute to the literature on health behaviors and financial hardship by highlighting the cyclical nature between different indicators of socioeconomic status, modifiable risk factors, and poor health outcomes among middle-aged and older adults. Furthermore, findings highlight how modifiable risk factors may culminate in financial hardship in later life.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper tests whether post-baccalaureate business certificates improve the job callback rates of applicants using a correspondence study. We randomly assign a post-baccalaureate certificate to fictitious resumes and apply to real vacancy postings for managerial, administrative and accounting assistant positions in several large cities on multiple large online job boards. We find no statistical relationship between having a certificate and the probability of receiving a callback, with the 95 % confidence interval being (−1.44, 0.50) percentage points with a baseline callback rate of 11.6%. Our results suggest that post-baccalaureate certificates may provide little value to job seekers, though it remains an unexplored question as to whether such certificates improve wage growth or promotions on the job.",

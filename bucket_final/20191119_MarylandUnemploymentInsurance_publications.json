        "abstract": "Many countries during the 1990s introduced Active Labour Market Programmes (ALMPs) in an effort to reduce unemployment. In countries such as Australia, USA, Denmark, Sweden, England and Switzerland, participation in an active labour market programme is required to continue receiving benefits (Gerfin and Lecher, 2002 and Geerdsen, 2003). Typically, compulsory programme participation is required after a certain period of time on unemployment insurance.\nThe purpose of making benefit payments conditional on participation in ALMPs is twofold. Firstly, participation in ALMPs may improve the participants’ qualifications and reintroduce them to the labour market. Secondly, the compulsory aspect may provide an incentive for unemployed individuals to look for and return to work prior to programme participation (Black, et al., 2003; Jackman, 1994; Hansen and Tranaes, 1999). A systematic review of the effect occurring prior to participation in a compulsory labor market programme (denoted the “threat effect”) is currently in progress (Bjorn et al, 2004).",

        "abstract": "This paper is a systematic review of the threat effect of active labor market programs for unemployed individuals. The threat effect is the induced change in the hazard rate of leaving unemployment prior to program participation. Studies included in the review all estimated a threat effect, with the participants in all cases being unemployed individuals in receipt of benefit of some kind during their tenure of unemployment. Eight of these studies have been included in a meta-analysis: The meta-analysis, which has been carried out using a random effects model to account for heterogeneity, indicated a hazard ratio of 1.25 for the pooled estimate. We conclude that active labor market programs constitute a statistically significant threat effect, although it is modest.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale social experiments were pioneered in labor economics, and are the basis for much of what we know about topics ranging from the effect of job training to incentives for job search to labor supply responses to taxation. Random assignment has provided a powerful solution to selection problems that bedevil non-experimental research. Nevertheless, many important questions about these topics require going beyond random assignment. This applies to questions pertaining to both internal and external validity, and includes effects on endogenously observed outcomes, such as wages and hours; spillover effects; site effects; heterogeneity in treatment effects; multiple and hidden treatments; and the mechanisms producing treatment effects. In this Chapter, we review the value and limitations of randomized social experiments in the labor market, with an emphasis on these design issues and approaches to addressing them. These approaches expand the range of questions that can be answered using experiments by combining experimental variation with econometric or theoretical assumptions. We also discuss efforts to build the means of answering these types of questions into the ex ante design of experiments. Our discussion yields an overview of the expanding toolkit available to experimental researchers.",

        "abstract": "DellaVigna and Paserman (2005) and Paserman (2008) have shown that imposing job search requirements on sophisticated unemployed benefit claimants with hyperbolic time preferences is Pareto improving in that it raises welfare for the unemployed, by limiting harmful procrastination, and for employees, since the enhanced search boosts the job finding rate, thereby reducing the contributions required for the funding of benefits. This paper demonstrates that the range of Pareto improvements is much reduced if the analysis takes into account the fact that benefit claimants may not comply with the requirements, especially if the monitoring technology displays imperfections induced by caseworker discretion or measurement error.",

The STAR METRICS program is a good example: legislators wanted immediate information about jobs resulting from the US stimulus funding, and agencies needed better data for analysis and reporting, but manual reporting of information from researchers and research institutions was unreliable and burdensome. The LEHD and LEED programs are examples of how administrative data can be used to create information about important economic activities that can’t readily be captured by survey data: namely the dynamic interactions of workers and firms – jobs.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical research involving human subjects has traditionally been treated as a unique endeavor, presenting special risks and demanding special protections. But in several ways, the regulatory scheme governing human subjects research is counter-intuitively less protective than the labor and employment laws applicable to many workers. This Article relies on analogical and legal reasoning to demonstrate that this should not be the case; in a number of ways, human research subjects ought to be fundamentally recast as human research workers. Like other workers protected under worklaw, biomedical research subjects often have interests that diverge from those in positions of control but little bargaining power for change. Bearing these important similarities in mind, the question becomes whether there is any good reason to treat subjects and protected workers differently as a matter of law. With regard to unrestricted payment, eligibility for a minimum wage, compensation for injury, and rights to engage in concerted activity, the answer is no and human subjects regulations ought to be revised accordingly.",

        "abstract": "One goal of the public employment service is to facilitate matching between unemployed job seekers and job vacancies; another goal is to monitor job search so as to bring search efforts among the unemployed in line with search requirements. The referral of job seekers to vacancies is one instrument used for these purposes. We report results from a randomized Swedish experiment where the outcome of referrals is examined. To what extent do unemployed individuals actually apply for the jobs they are referred to? Does information to job seekers about increased monitoring affect the probability of applying and the probability of leaving unemployment? The experiment indicates that a relatively large fraction (one third) of the referrals do not result in job applications. Information about intensified monitoring causes an increase in the probability of job application, especially among young people. However, we find no significant impact on the duration of unemployment.",

        "abstract": "Since July 2004, the job search effort of long-term unemployed benefit claimants has been monitored in Belgium. We exploit the discontinuity in the treatment assignment at the age of 30 present in the first year of the reform to evaluate the effect of a notification sent at least eight months before job search is verified. Eight months after this notification and prior to the first monitoring interview, transitions to employment have increased by nearly nine percentage points compared to the counterfactual of no reform. Participation in training is raised, but not significantly, while withdrawals from the labor force are not affected.",

        "abstract": "One justification for extended retention of program administrative data is a resulting capability to study whether and how often repeated, concurrent and sequential appearances are found in multiple program transaction records. The expected return-on-investment from extended retention of administrative data rises when coverage of multiple programmatic interventions is consolidated in an integrated data system. This report is based on a preliminary exploration of linked historical administrative data files containing recorded instances of individual participation in defined education, workforce and social service programs. Our results to date should be treated as illustrative of decision-relevant insights that future refinements can produce. To explore the incidence of repeated, concurrent and sequential participation in more than one government program we accessed two workforce, threepublic education, and two social services administrative data files. We document that many individuals do engage in multiple workforce, education and social services program activities, and in repeated participation within each of the program types. There are many reasons for sustained interest in reliable measurement of repeated and combined program engagements. Some combinations and sequences are looked upon favorably, while others are viewed with some concern. Care should be exercised to avoid hasty conclusions about the benefits and costs that can be assigned to particular combinations of program engagements. Our next steps will include renewed attention to dynamic person identification and program engagement methodologies, while continuing the design and implementation of our study of up to 27 years of multiple program engagements by 1984 credit-course enrollees in Maryland’s public community colleges.",

        "abstract": "Using Maryland administrative data between 1996 and 2005, this paper examines the impact of local labor market conditions on work and welfare use among single mothers. Our estimates rely on the new Census Bureau Quarterly Workforce Indicators database, which provides county-level economic indicators filtered by industry, gender, and age-group. We specify a multinomial choice model to estimate the effects of these local labor market variables on the full set of work–welfare combinations. The results indicate that lower unemployment rates and increased new hires and new hires’ earnings in key industries increase the likelihood that women choose alternatives that include work. African American women and those with fewer years of education respond differently to changing economic conditions.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates long-term returns from unemployment compensation, exploiting variation from the UK JSA reform of 1996, which implied a major increase in job search requirements for eligibility and in the related administrative hurdle. Search theory predicts that such changes should raise the proportion of non-claimant nonemployed, with consequences on search effort and labor market attachment, and lower the reservation wage of the unemployed, with negative effects on post-unemployment wages. I test these ideas on longitudinal data from Social Security records (LLMDB). Using a difference in differences approach, I find that individuals who start an unemployment spell soon after JSA introduction, as opposed to six months earlier, are 2.5-3% more likely to move from unemployment into Incapacity Benefits spells, and 4-5% less likely to have positive earnings in the following year. This latter employment effect only vanishes four years after the initial unemployment shock. Also, annual earnings for the treated individuals are lower than for the non treated. These results suggest that while tighter search requirements were successful in moving individuals off unemployment benefits, they were not successful in moving them onto long-lasting or better jobs, with fairly long lasting unintended consequences on a number of labor market outcomes.",

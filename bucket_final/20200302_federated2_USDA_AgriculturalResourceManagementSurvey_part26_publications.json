        "abstract": "Low response rates for the Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase III (ARMS III) are a growing concern. Beginning in 2011 and enhanced in 2012, data mining techniques were used to proactively identify operations that are likely to be nonrespondents to ARMS III. Once identified, a measure of the impact on the calibration targets of each likely nonrespondent was calculated. Likely nonrespondents were then divided into a treatment and control group to evaluate data collection methods. Likely nonrespondents in the treatment group were targeted with more intense data collection strategies in an effort to increase response rates. These strategies were evaluated to determine whether they could increase response to the survey but because these strategies were not uniformly applied, definitive conclusions about their effectiveness cannot be drawn.",

        "abstract": "Federal tax policy affects the economic behavior and well-being of farm households, as well as the management and profitability of farms. Recent calls for reforming current tax law could fundamentally changing the Federal income tax system by eliminating most itemized deductions and modifying credits, while restructuring capital gains and dividend tax rates, lowering tax rates on individual and business income, as well as reducing the number of tax brackets. At the same time, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act calls for the expansion of some business provisions, and in particular that relate to capital cost recovery. The reforms, if enacted, could have a significant impact on the after-tax income and well-being of both farms and farm households. This paper uses farm-level data from USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey to examine the current tax situation for farm households and to evaluate the impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may have on them.",

We address self-selection into organic farming by using propensity score matching and explicitly test the hypothesis that organic and conventional farms employ a single, homogeneous technology. Utilizing the 2005 Agricultural Resource Management Survey on Dairy Costs and Returns Report (ARMS) data, we reject the homogeneous technology hypothesis and find that the organic dairy technology is approximately 13% less productive. However, we find little difference in technical efficiency between organic and conventional farms when technical efficiency is measured against the appropriate technology.

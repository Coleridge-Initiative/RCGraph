        "abstract": "Abstract Vegetation barriers along roads can mitigate the effects of air pollution from traffic. Here, we measure a range of air pollutants in front and behind a hedge during the dormancy, greenup and part of the maturity vegetation cycle along with auxiliary variables. This is the first time a long time-series measuring multiple pollutants on both sides of a hedge is presented. This time-series allows assessing the influence of the annual vegetation cycle, wind direction and high versus low concentrations of both gaseous and particulate matter pollutants across a hedge. A marked jump in concentrations of particles happens after the hedge is greening up; this jump was not seen for gases. For example, a concentration difference for CO and PM1 of −8%, −1% for PM2.5 and −3% for NO2 and +10% for PM10 during dormancy and greenup was measured. At the beginning of the maturity phase, all three PM fractions experience a rapid increase in concentration difference, not seen for gases, to −52% for PM1, −44% for PM2.5 and −35% for PM10. The effect of wind direction is shown to be minor. These measurements are a first step towards an accurate assessment of city-scale air pollution mitigation potential of hedge-like vegetation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWhile previous studies uncovered individual vulnerabilities to health risks during catastrophic storms, few evaluated the population vulnerability which is more important for identifying areas in greatest need of intervention.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nWe assessed the association between community factors and multiple health outcomes, and developed a community vulnerability index.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retained emergency department visits for several health conditions from the 2005-2014 New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. We developed distributed lag nonlinear models at each spatial cluster across eight counties in downstate New York to evaluate the health risk associated with Superstorm Sandy (10/28/2012-11/9/2012) compared to the same period in other years, then defined census tracts in clusters with an elevated risk as \"risk-elevated communities\", and all others as \"unelevated\". We used machine-learning techniques to regress the risk elevation status against community factors to determine the contribution of each factor on population vulnerability, and developed a community vulnerability index (CVI).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, community factors had positive contributions to increased community vulnerabilities to Sandy-related substance abuse (91.35%), injuries (70.51%), cardiovascular diseases (8.01%), and mental disorders (2.71%) but reversely contributed to respiratory diseases (-34.73%). The contribution of low per capita income (max: 22.08%), the percentage of residents living in group quarters (max: 31.39%), the percentage of areas prone to flooding (max: 38.45%), and the percentage of green coverage (max: 29.73%) tended to be larger than other factors. The CVI based on these factors achieved an accuracy of 0.73-0.90 across outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggested that substance abuse was the most sensitive disease susceptible to less optimal community indicators, whereas respiratory diseases were higher in communities with better social environment. The percentage of residents in group quarters and areas prone to flooding were among dominant predictors for community vulnerabilities. The CVI based on these factors has an appropriate predictive performance.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundExtreme heat (EH) and extreme precipitation (EP) events are expected to increase with climate change in many parts of the world. Characterizing the potential future morbidity and mortality burden of EH and EP and associated costs, as well as uncertainties in the estimates, can identify areas for public health intervention and inform adaptation strategies. We demonstrate a burden of disease and uncertainty assessment using data from Michigan, USA, and provide approaches for deriving these estimates for locations lacking certain data inputs.MethodsCase-crossover analysis adapted from previous Michigan-specific modeling was used to characterize the historical EH-mortality relationship by county poverty rate and age group. Historical EH-associated hospitalization and emergency room visit risks from the literature were adapted to Michigan. In the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s BenMAP software, we used a novel approach, with multiple spatially-varying exposures, to estimate all non-accidental mortality and morbidity occurring on EH days (EH days; days where maximum temperature 32.2–35 C or > 35 C) and EP days. We did so for two time periods: the “historical” period (1971–2000), and the “projected” period (2041–2070), by county.ResultsThe rate of all non-accidental mortality associated with EH days increased from 0.46/100,000 persons historically to 2.9/100,000 in the projected period, for 240 EH-attributable deaths annually. EH-associated ED visits increased from 12/100,000 persons to 68/100,000 persons, for 7800 EH-attributable emergency department visits. EP-associated ED visits increased minimally from 1.7 to 1.9/100,000 persons. Mortality and morbidity were highest among those aged 65+ (91% of all deaths). Projected health costs are dominated by EH-associated mortality ($280 million) and EH-associated emergency department visits ($14 million). A variety of sources contribute to a moderate-to-high degree of uncertainty around the point estimates, including uncertainty in the magnitude of climate change, population composition, baseline health rates, and exposure-response estimates.ConclusionsThe approach applied here showed that health burden due to climate may significantly rise for all Michigan counties by midcentury. The costs to health care and uncertainties in the estimates, given the potential for substantial attributable burden, provide additional information to guide adaptation measures for EH and EP.",

        "abstract": "Northwestern India is known as the “breadbasket” of the country producing two-thirds of food grains, with wheat and rice as the principal crops grown under the crop rotation system. Agricultural data from India indicates a 25% increase in the post-monsoon rice crop production in Punjab during 2002–2016. NASA’s A-train satellite sensors detect a consistent increase in the vegetation index (net 21%) and post-harvest agricultural fire activity (net ~60%) leading to nearly 43% increase in aerosol loading over the populous Indo-Gangetic Plain in northern India. The ground-level particulate matter (PM2.5) downwind over New Delhi shows a concurrent uptrend of net 60%. The effectiveness of a robust satellite-based relationship between vegetation index—a proxy for crop amounts, and post-harvest fires—a precursor of extreme air pollution events, has been further demonstrated in predicting the seasonal agricultural burning. An efficient crop residue management system is critically needed towards eliminating open field burning to mitigate episodic hazardous air quality over northern India.",

        "abstract": "Patients with chronic pain commonly believe their pain is related to the weather. Scientific evidence to support their beliefs is inconclusive, in part due to difficulties in getting a large dataset of patients frequently recording their pain symptoms during a variety of weather conditions. Smartphones allow the opportunity to collect data to overcome these difficulties. Our study Cloudy with a Chance of Pain analysed daily data from 2658 patients collected over a 15-month period. The analysis demonstrated significant yet modest relationships between pain and relative humidity, pressure and wind speed, with correlations remaining even when accounting for mood and physical activity. This research highlights how citizen-science experiments can collect large datasets on real-world populations to address long-standing health questions. These results will act as a starting point for a future system for patients to better manage their health through pain forecasts.",

        "abstract": "Sand flies are responsible for the transmission of leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease claiming more than 50,000 lives annually. Leishmaniasis is an emerging health risk in tropical and Mediterranean countries as well as temperate regions in North America and Europe. There is an increasing demand for predicting population dynamics and spreading of sand flies to support management and control, yet phenotypic diversity and complex environmental dependence hamper model development. Here, we present the principles for developing predictive species-specific population dynamics models for important disease vectors. Based on these principles, we developed a sand fly population dynamics model with a generic structure where model parameters are inferred using a surveillance dataset collected from Greece and Cyprus. The model incorporates distinct life stages and explicit dependence on a carefully selected set of environmental variables. The model successfully replicates the observations and demonstrates high predictive capacity on the validation dataset from Turkey. The surveillance datasets inform about biological processes, even in the absence of laboratory experiments. Our findings suggest that the methodology can be applied to other vector species to predict abundance, control dispersion, and help to manage the global burden of vector-borne diseases.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiologic analyses of the health effects of meteorological exposures typically rely on observations from the nearest weather station to assess exposure for geographically diverse populations. Gridded climate datasets (GCD) provide spatially resolved weather data that may offer improved exposure estimates, but have not been systematically validated for use in epidemiologic evaluations. As a validation, we linearly regressed daily weather estimates from two GCDs, PRISM and Daymet, to observations from a sample of weather stations across the conterminous United States and compared spatially resolved, population-weighted county average temperatures and heat indices from PRISM to single-pixel PRISM values at the weather stations to identify differences. We found that both Daymet and PRISM accurately estimate ambient temperature and mean heat index at sampled weather stations, but PRISM outperforms Daymet for assessments of humidity and maximum daily heat index. Moreover, spatially-resolved exposure estimates differ from point-based assessments, but with substantial inter-county heterogeneity. We conclude that GCDs offer a potentially useful approach to exposure assessment of meteorological variables that may, in some locations, reduce exposure measurement error, as well as permit assessment of populations distributed far from weather stations.",

        "abstract": "Effective and accurate modeling of air quality in complex terrain constitutes one of the main challenges for the community of modelers. One of the basic problems is the selection of input data of adequate quality in combination with a uniform configuration of the modeling systems. Simultaneously, the primary aim is to obtain predictions of satisfying accuracy. In the article the results of the evaluation for the CALMET/CALPUFF modeling system in near-field and complex terrain were presented. Research was conducted based on three experimental databases for the dispersion model evaluation, i.e. Martin's Creek (SO2), Lovett (SO2) and Tracy Power Plant (SF6). Each experiment concerned an area characterized by different topography, meteorological conditions, emission source features and the location of tracer substance monitors (SO2, SF6). The aim of the study was to determine the optimal settings for the CALMET/CALPUFF models with regard to the digital elevation model dataset (GTOPO30, SRTM3, NED), grid resolution (ranging from 100 to 4000 m) and the terrain adjustment methods available in the CALPUFF model (MCTADJ = 0, 1, 2 and 3). The results of the CALMET/CALPUFF accuracy evaluation showed, that the use of the digital elevation model (DEM) with a horizontal accuracy of approximately 90 m and a vertical accuracy of 15 m (SRTM3) is sufficient. Application of more accurate data (NED) resulted in comparable model evaluation outcomes. Using both dense and coarse grids resulted in FB and/or FBRHC higher than 0.6. Omitting the terrain adjustment method in the CALPUFF model results in the twofold underestimation of the measurements. The best results of the CALMET/CALPUFF accuracy evaluation for each experiment (|FB| < 0.30, FAC = 1.0, NAD ≤ 0.15, VG < 1.12, IOA > 0.5) were achieved for the grid resolution of 400 m with the use of a partial plume path adjustment method (MCTADJ = 3).",

        "abstract": "Historical reanalyses that span more than a century are needed for a wide range of studies, from understanding large‐scale climate trends to diagnosing the impacts of individual historical extreme weather events. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) Project is an effort to fill this need. It is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and is facilitated by collaboration with the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative. 20CR is the first ensemble of sub‐daily global atmospheric conditions spanning over 100 years. This provides a best estimate of the weather at any given place and time as well as an estimate of its confidence and uncertainty. While extremely useful, version 2c of this dataset (20CRv2c) has several significant issues, including inaccurate estimates of confidence and a global sea level pressure bias in the mid‐19th century. These and other issues can reduce its effectiveness for studies at many spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the 20CR system underwent a series of developments to generate a significant new version of the reanalysis. The version 3 system (NOAA‐CIRES‐DOE 20CRv3) uses upgraded data assimilation methods including an adaptive inflation algorithm; has a newer, higher‐resolution forecast model that specifies dry air mass; and assimilates a larger set of pressure observations. These changes have improved the ensemble‐based estimates of confidence, removed spin‐up effects in the precipitation fields, and diminished the sea‐level pressure bias. Other improvements include more accurate representations of storm intensity, smaller errors, and large‐scale reductions in model bias. The 20CRv3 system is comprehensively reviewed, focusing on the aspects that have ameliorated issues in 20CRv2c. Despite the many improvements, some challenges remain, including a systematic bias in tropical precipitation and time‐varying biases in southern high‐latitude pressure fields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Winds generated from thunderstorms have been shown to be important in wind engineering. However, the collection of data for these events has been limited. In this study, thunderstorm wind speeds from airport surface stations (i.e., ASOS) in the United States (U.S.) were analyzed. Overall the analysis showed significant directional and regional preferences. The results revealed that a large majority of thunderstorm wind speeds >75 mph (33.4 m/s) had a westerly component and had a preference toward the central United States. Annual maximum wind speeds >29 mph (12.4 m/s) from over 400 ASOS stations were employed in a cluster analysis using k-means. For both non-directional and directional analyses, the statistical character of the wind speeds is different for different wind speed magnitudes. Probability distributions fit to the data showed best fit to a generalized extreme value distribution with an average shape parameter of approximately −0.1, suggesting a Gumbel fit would be conservative. Statistical analysis also revealed the significance of small sample sizes and the presence of ‘outliers’, that when analyzed, had a significant effect on the parameters of the fitted probability distribution. A simple data-driven methodology is proposed to utilize both site-specific and regional data in extreme wind analysis.",

        "abstract": "In recent decades, most big cities in China have experienced severe air pollution accompanied by rapid economic and social development. Analysis of measurements of air pollutants form a fundamental basis for understanding the characteristics of air pollution and are important references for policy-making. In this study, five-year measurements of air pollutants at 6 sites in Lhasa, a typical high altitude big city in southwestern China, were analyzed from January 2013 to December 2017. Air pollutants at all the 6 sites in Lhasa generally displayed similar patterns of both diurnal and monthly variations, indicating the mixed atmospheric environment and the overall effect of the meteorological conditions in the city. Spatially, the air pollutant concentrations at the 6 sites were generally characterized by high concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5 at urban sites and high O3 concentrations at suburban sites. In comparison with other provincial capital cities in China, Lhasa has low concentrations of air pollutants, except for O3, and thus, better air quality. Although Lhasa has experienced rapid urbanization and economic development, air pollution conditions have remained rather stable and even decreased slightly in term of particular air pollutants. We suggested that the relatively isolated location, low air pollutant emissions associated with its industrial structure and renewable energy consumption, and effective air pollution control measures, collectively contributed to the synchronous improvement of the economy and air quality in Lhasa. Such \"Lhasa pattern\" may serve as a positive example for other regional hub cities in China and beyond that experience socioeconomic development and simultaneously seek to improve air quality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Several field campaigns were conducted in the framework of the\nDynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud Interactions in West Africa (DACCIWA)\nproject to measure a broad range of atmospheric constituents. Here we\npresent the analysis of an unprecedented and comprehensive dataset\nintegrating up to 56 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from ambient\nsites and emission sources. VOCs were collected on multi-sorbent tubes in the\ncoastal city of Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, in winter and summer 2016 and\nlater analysed by gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization and mass\nspectrometer detectors (GC-FID and GC-MS) at the laboratory. The comparison between VOC emission source profiles and ambient profiles\nsuggests the substantial impact of two-stroke motorized two-wheel vehicles\nand domestic fires on the composition of Abidjan's atmosphere. However,\ndespite high VOC concentrations near-source, moderate ambient levels were\nobserved (by factors of 10 to 4000 lower), similar to the concentrations\nobserved in northern mid-latitude urban areas. Besides photochemistry, the\nreported high wind speeds seem to be an essential factor that regulates air\npollution levels in Abidjan. Emission ratios ( ΔVOC∕ΔCO ) were established based on\nreal-world measurements achieved for a selected number of representative\ncombustion sources. Maximum measured molar mass emissions were observed from\ntwo-wheel vehicles, surpassing other regional sources by 2 orders of\nmagnitude. Local practices like waste burning also make a significant\ncontribution to VOC emissions, higher than those from light-duty vehicles by\n1.5 to 8 orders of magnitude. These sources also largely govern the VOC's\natmospheric impacts in terms of OH reactivity, secondary organic aerosol\nformation (SOAP), and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). While\nthe contribution of aromatics dominates the atmospheric impact, our\nmeasurements reveal the systematic presence of anthropogenic terpenoids in\nall residential combustion sectors. Finally, emission factors were used to\nretrieve and quantify VOC emissions from the main anthropogenic source\nsectors at the national level. Our detailed estimation of VOC emissions\nsuggests that the road transport sector is the dominant source in Cote\nd'Ivoire, emitting around 1200  Gg yr−1 of gas-phase VOCs. These new\nestimates are 100 and 160 times larger than global inventory estimations\nfrom MACCity or EDGAR (v4.3.2), respectively. Additionally, the residential\nsector is largely underestimated in the global emission inventories, by\nfactors of 13 to 43. Considering only Cote d'Ivoire, these new estimates\nfor VOCs are 3 to 6 times higher than the whole of Europe. Given the\nsignificant underestimation of VOC emissions from the transport and residential\nsectors in Cote d'Ivoire, there is an urgent need to build more\nrealistic and region-specific emission inventories for the entire West\nAfrican region. This might be true not only for VOCs, but also for all atmospheric\npollutants. The lack of waste burning, wood fuel burning and charcoal\nburning, and fabrication representation in regional inventories also needs to\nbe addressed, particularly in low-income areas where these types of\nactivities are ubiquitous sources of VOC emissions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. A 5-year Clean Air Action Plan was implemented in 2013 to reduce air\npollutant emissions and improve ambient air quality in Beijing. Assessment\nof this action plan is an essential part of the decision-making process to\nreview its efficacy and to develop new policies. Both\nstatistical and chemical transport modelling have been previously applied to\nassess the efficacy of this action plan. However, inherent uncertainties in\nthese methods mean that new and independent methods are required to support\nthe assessment process. Here, we applied a machine-learning-based random\nforest technique to quantify the effectiveness of Beijing's action plan by\ndecoupling the impact of meteorology on ambient air quality. Our results\ndemonstrate that meteorological conditions have an important impact on the\nyear-to-year variations in ambient air quality. Further analyses show that\nthe PM 2.5 mass concentration would have broken the target of the plan\n(2017 annual PM 2.5 µ g m −3 ) were it not for the\nmeteorological conditions in winter 2017 favouring the dispersion of air\npollutants. However, over the whole period (2013–2017), the primary\nemission controls required by the action plan have led to significant\nreductions in PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO2 , SO2 , and CO from 2013 to 2017 of approximately 34 %, 24 %, 17 %, 68 %, and 33 %, respectively, after meteorological correction. The marked decrease in PM 2.5 and SO2 is largely attributable to a reduction in coal\ncombustion. Our results indicate that the action plan has been highly\neffective in reducing the primary pollution emissions and improving air\nquality in Beijing. The action plan offers a successful example for\ndeveloping air quality policies in other regions of China and other\ndeveloping countries.",

        "abstract": "Collecting energy use data is becoming common practice in the buildings sector. Current applications include understanding regional energy flows in the building stock, and tracking energy performance of individual buildings. Beyond these, research and commercial applications of building energy data are as yet unexplored. Research is needed to provide insight into the data being collected, to identify appropriate applications of these data, and opportunities to improve data collection efforts. To that end, we present an exploratory analysis of the existing public large-scale building energy datasets, focusing on the two largest datasets: the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey and the Building Performance Database. We provide backgound information on both datasets, present an overview of the detail and sparsity of information in each, and report on the relationships we observe between data fields included in the two datasets, and compare our findings with results from the literature. We discuss how these results could be applied to support energy efficiency investments, and opportunities to improve data collection efforts to ensure that the data collected are adequate to provide insight into building energy consumption and support novel applications of building energy data.",

Drawing on insights from psychology and behavioral decision theory, we describe how affect influences agent risk behavior. We argue that positive affect amplifies both the extent to which executives reduce strategic risk taking in response to risk bearing and engage in strategic risk taking in response to incentives for further enrichment. Building again on the psychology literature, we describe how CEO accountability attenuates the influence of affect on CEO risk behavior in response to stock option incentives. We test our expectations in a longitudinal data set of CEO stock option incentives, affect, and strategic risk taking by U.S. firms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Ambient PM2.5 pollution has been a major environmental concern in recent years. Beijing, the capital of China, is enduring frequent and severe PM2.5 pollution. In this study, 186 valid PM2.5 pollution episodes during the 2014-2017 period were identified and classified into four categories according to the mechanism of pollution formation and evolution. Category I often occurs in autumn, winter and early spring, depending on accumulation during stagnant weather. Category II featured by photochemistry is dominant in summer, and category III caused by dust storms occasionally occurs in spring. Category IV represents a combination during transition periods. Interannual variations show that particulate pollution decreased from 2014 to 2017, and the decline in categories I and II played the most important role. To further understand the PM2.5 pollution patterns in Beijing, the temporal and spatial characteristics and relationships between PM2.5 levels and meteorological features were analyzed. Category I is the main pollution type that brings forth heavy or severe pollution and has the longest duration in those cases, while category II often leads to light or moderate pollution. There is a north-south gap in the PM2.5 levels in Beijing. The high-level pollution in category I tends to evolve northward, while the low-level pollution in category I and category II pollution tend to evolve southward and widen the north-south gap, affected by the regional transport and more local emissions in the south. Additionally, the relationship between the concentrations and meteorology also vary with the pollution categories. High relative humidity, low wind speeds and low boundary layer heights are likely to lead to category I or II pollution, but category III requires high winds. These results provide insights into the annual tendency and characteristics of Beijing's particulate pollution in recent years.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Hourly global solar radiation is a significant parameter for building thermal simulation and building cooling design. Most of the solar radiation models focus on the monthly or daily values, but very few studies have been carried out on the hourly values. The Zhang and Huang model was developed for estimating the hourly solar radiation based on the dry-bulb temperature difference, relative humidity and cloud cover. In this study, a new model is proposed for all-sky conditions based on the hourly/daily radiation ratio retrieved from the Zhang and Huang model and the measured daily solar radiation dataset. Compared with the Zhang and Huang model, the proposed model is more accurate (the average of R2, 0.90) and the average of RMSE is improved by 29.54%. The latest hourly solar radiation dataset for 17 locations in China from 2006 to 2016 is subsequently established using the proposed model, which can be used to generate the latest Typical Meteorological Year (TMY). As one of the significant applications to buildings, two kinds of hourly solar radiation datasets (the frequency levels of 95% and 97.5%) for 17 locations are also developed, which are usable for air-conditioning design.",

Daily Fire Weather Index (FWI) System components calculated from the NASA he Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) are compared to FWI calculations from a global network of weather stations over 2004-2018, and short-term, experimental (8-day) daily FWI forecasts are evaluated for their skill across the Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World for 2018. FWI components from MERRA2 were, in general, biased low compared to station data, but this reflects a mix of coherent low and high biases of different magnitudes. Biases in different MERRA2 FWI components were related to different biases in weather input variables for different regions, but temperature and relative humidity biases were the most important overall. FWI forecasts had high skill for 1–2 day lead times for most of the world. For longer lead-times, forecast skill decreased most quickly at high latitudes, and was most closely related to decreasing skill of relative humidity forecasts. These results provide a baseline for the evaluation and use of fire weather products calculated from global analysis and forecast fields.",

        "abstract": "Data from weather stations at airports, far away locations or predictions using macro-level data may not be accurate enough to disseminate visibility related information to motorists in advance. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the influence of contributing factors and develop visibility prediction models, at road link-level, by considering data from weather stations located within 1.6 km of state routes, US routes and interstates in the state of North Carolina (NC). Four years of meteorological data, from January 2011 to December 2014, were collected within NC. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and weighted least squares (WLS) regression models were developed for different visibility and elevation ranges. The results indicate that elevation and cloud cover are negatively associated with low visibility. The chances of low visibility are higher between six to twelve hours after rainfall when compared to the first six hours after rainfall. A visibility sensor was installed at four different locations in NC to compare hourly visibility from the selected regression model, High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) data, and the nearest weather station. The results indicate that the number of samples with zero error range was higher for the selected regression model compared with the HRRR and weather station observations.",

        "abstract": "This study examines whether mood affects the aggregate state-level macroeconomy through its impact on firm-level decisions. Using sky cloud cover as a proxy for mood, we show that mood affects the economic expectations of small business managers. After relatively sunnier periods, managers have more optimistic expectations, and the component of their expectations related to mood influences hiring and investment decisions. Consequently, mood affects state-level job creation and new business starts, especially during periods of greater economic uncertainty. These results suggest that mood-induced economic expectations influence firm-level managerial decisions and state-level macroeconomic fluctuations.",

        "abstract": "Winter storms pose numerous hazards to the Northeast United States, including rain, snow, strong wind, and flooding. These hazards can cause millions of dollars in damages from one storm alone. This study investigates meteorological intensity and impacts of winter storms from 2001 to 2014 on coastal counties in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York and underscores the consequences of winter storms. The study selected 70 winter storms on the basis of station observations of surface wind strength, heavy precipitation, high storm tide, and snow extremes. Storm rankings differed between measures, suggesting that intensity is not easily defined with a single metric. Several storms fell into two or more categories (multiple-category storms). Following storm selection, property damages were examined to determine which types lead to high losses. The analysis of hazards (or events) and associated damages using the Storm Events Database of the National Centers for Environmental Information indicates that multiple-category storms were responsible for a greater portion of the damage. Flooding was responsible for the highest losses, but no discernible connection exists between the number of storms that afflict a county and the damage it faces. These results imply that losses may rely more on the incidence of specific hazards, infrastructure types, and property values, which vary throughout the region.",

        "abstract": "Cold weather was estimated to account for more than half of weather-related deaths in the U.S. during 2006-2010. Studies have shown that cold-related excessive mortality is especially relevant with decreasing latitude or in regions with mild winter. However, only limited studies have been conducted in the southern U.S. The purpose of our study is to examine impacts of cold weather on mortality in 12 major Texas Metropolitan Areas (MSAs) for the 22-year period, 1990-2011. Our study used a two-stage approach to examine the cold-mortality association. We first applied distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) to 12 major MSAs to estimate cold effects for each area. A random effects meta-analysis was then used to estimate pooled effects. Age-stratified and cause-specific mortalities were modeled separately for each MSA. Most of the MSAs were associated with an increased risk in mortality ranging from 0.1% to 5.0% with a 1 °C decrease in temperature below the cold thresholds. Higher increased mortality risks were generally observed in MSAs with higher average daily mean temperatures and lower latitudes. Pooled effect estimate was 1.58% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.81, 2.37]) increase in all-cause mortality risk with a 1 °C decrease in temperature. Cold wave effects in Texas were also examined, and several MSAs along the Texas Gulf Coast showed statistically significant cold wave-mortality associations. Effects of cold on all-cause mortality were highest among people over 75 years old (1.86%, 95% CI [1.09, 2.63]). Pooled estimates for cause-specific mortality were strongest in myocardial infarction (4.30%, 95% CI [1.18, 7.51]), followed by respiratory diseases (3.17%, 95% CI [0.26, 6.17]) and ischemic heart diseases (2.54%, 95% CI [1.08, 4.02]). In conclusion, cold weather generally increases mortality risk significantly in Texas, and the cold effects vary with MSAs, age groups, and cause-specific deaths.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System is the mostly widely used fire danger rating system in the world. We have developed a global database of daily FWI System calculations, beginning in 1980, called the Global Fire WEather Database (GFWED) gridded to a spatial resolution of 0.5° latitude by 2/3° longitude. Input weather data were obtained from the NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and two different estimates of daily precipitation from rain gauges over land. FWI System Drought Code calculations from the gridded data sets were compared to calculations from individual weather station data for a representative set of 48 stations in North, Central and South America, Europe, Russia, Southeast Asia and Australia. Agreement between gridded calculations and the station-based calculations tended to be most different at low latitudes for strictly MERRA-based calculations. Strong biases could be seen in either direction: MERRA DC over the Mato Grosso in Brazil reached unrealistically high values exceeding DC = 1500 during the dry season but was too low over Southeast Asia during the dry season. These biases are consistent with those previously identified in MERRA's precipitation, and they reinforce the need to consider alternative sources of precipitation data. GFWED can be used for analyzing historical relationships between fire weather and fire activity at continental and global scales, in identifying large-scale atmosphere–ocean controls on fire weather, and calibration of FWI-based fire prediction models.",

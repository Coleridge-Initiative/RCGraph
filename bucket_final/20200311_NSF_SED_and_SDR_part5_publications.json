        "abstract": "The number of postdoctoral researchers has increased dramatically in the past decade. Because of the limited number of academic staff openings and the general levels of salary, the role and value of the postdoctoral appointment are changing. Using a sample of respondents with continuous data in the 1999 through 2008 Survey of Doctoral Recipients, this study examined whether taking a postdoctoral position contributed to one’s faculty career and salary 10 years after doctorate completion. Results show that completing a postdoctoral position positively contributed to working in educational institutions and securing a tenure-track appointment. Taking one, but not two or more, postdoctoral positions increased one’s written scholarly productivity. However, the postdoctoral experience had no statistically significant impact on one’s salary a decade after degree completion. Implications are discussed for institutional and higher education policy.",

Dissertation studies earned an average of 64.4% of the possible quality points across all methodology types, compared to studies in journals that averaged 47.2%. Doctoral students as well as their mentors can play a pivotal role in increasing the quality of research in this area by attending to the QF categories as they plan, design, implement, and complete their dissertation studies. These results imply that mathematics education technology researchers should demand greater clarity in published papers through the preparation of their own manuscripts and how they review the works of others.",

        "abstract": "In this report. . . Total costs of producing milk in 2000 ranged from an average of $11.58 per hundredweight (cwt) of milk sold in the Fruitful Rim-West region to $18.23 per cwt in the Eastern Uplands. Milk producers in the West had a significant cost advantage over producers in other regions in 2000 because their operations were much larger. Operations with 500 or more milk cows had significantly lower total operating and ownership costs, indicative of the economies of size experienced by larger operations. Also, differences in animal performance, feed efficiency, and labor efficiency were critical in determining whether producers were in the low- or high-cost group for producing milk. These findings were based on the 2000 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), the most recent national survey of milk producers.",

        "abstract": "In recent years a growing body of literature in the agricultural policy arena has examined the association between crop insurance and off-farm employment. However, little is known about the extent to which these two activities may be related to environmental quality, in particular their impacts on fertilizer/chemical use of the farm. To fill this gap, this paper examines the effect of crop insurance and off-farm work on fertilizer/chemical expenses within the farm household framework. Quantile regression results from a national representative farm-level data show that off-farm work by the farm operator tends to decrease fertilizer/chemical expenses, and the effect is more pronounced at the higher percentiles of the distribution of fertilizer/chemical expense. In contrast, a positive effect of crop insurance on fertilizer/chemical expenses is evident, and the effect is robust across the entire distribution.",

        "abstract": "This study uses the Ricardian (hedonic) approach to estimate the impact of potential climate change on agricultural farmland values in the Southeast U.S. as a distinct agricultural region. Using the Agricultural Resource Management Survey and seasonal county-level climate and data, we find that regional farmland values increase with spring and fall temperatures and fall precipitation and decrease with winter and summer temperatures. Long-term climate change projections predict aggregate farmland value losses of 2.5â€“5% with differential state-level impacts, ranging from large losses in Florida to significant gains in Virginia. The results are consistent with recent research and can be helpful in policy design and forecasting land use change.",

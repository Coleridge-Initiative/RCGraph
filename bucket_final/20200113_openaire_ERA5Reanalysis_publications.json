        "abstract": "Abstract. Extensive observational and numerical investigations have been performed to better characterize cloud properties. However, due to the large variations of cloud spatiotemporal distributions and physical properties, quantitative depictions of clouds in different atmospheric reanalysis datasets are still highly uncertain, and cloud parameters in the models to produce those datasets remain largely unconstrained. A radiance-based evaluation approach is introduced and performed to assess the quality of cloud properties by directly comparing reanalysis-driven forward radiative transfer results with radiances from satellite observation. The newly developed China Meteorological Administration Reanalysis data (CRA), the ECMWF’s Fifth-generation Reanalysis (ERA5), and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) are considered in the present study. To avoid the unrealistic assumptions and uncertainties on satellite retrieval algorithms and products, the radiative transfer model (RTM) is used as a bridge to “translate” the reanalysis to corresponding satellite observations. The simulated reflectance and brightness temperatures (BTs) are directly compared with observations from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 satellite in the region from 80° E to 160° W between 60° N and 60° S, especially for results over East Asia. Comparisons of the reflectance in the solar and BTs in the infrared (IR) window channels reveal that CRA reanalysis better represents the total cloud cover than the other two reanalysis datasets. The simulated BTs for CRA and ERA5 are close to each other in many pixels, whereas the vertical distributions of cloud properties are significantly different, and ERA5 depicts a better deep convection structure than CRA reanalysis. Comparisons of the BT differences (BTDs) between the simulations and observations suggest that the water clouds are generally overestimated in ERA5 and MERRA-2, whereas the ice cloud is responsible for the overestimation over the center of cyclones in ERA5. Overall, the cloud from CRA, ERA5, and MERRA-2 show their own advantages in different aspects. The ERA5 reanalysis is found the most capability in representing the cloudy atmosphere over East Asia, and the results in CRA are close to those in ERA5.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has recently released its most advanced reanalysis product, the ERA5 dataset. It was designed and generated with methods giving it multiple advantages over the previous release, the ERA-Interim reanalysis product. Notably, it has a finer spatial resolution, is archived at the hourly time step, uses a more advanced assimilation system and includes more sources of data. This paper aims to evaluate the ERA5 reanalysis as a potential reference dataset for hydrological modelling by considering the ERA5 precipitation and temperatures as proxies for observations in the hydrological modelling process, using two lumped hydrological models over 3138 North-American catchments. This study shows that ERA5-based hydrological modeling performance is equivalent to using observations over most of North-America, with the exception of the Eastern half of the US, where observations lead to consistently better performance. ERA5 temperature and precipitation biases are consistently reduced compared to ERA-Interim and systematically more accurate for hydrological modelling. Differences between ERA5, ERA-Interim and observation datasets are mostly linked to precipitation, as temperature only marginally influences the hydrological simulation outcomes.",

The ERA5 reanalysis, recently made available by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), is a new reanalysis product at a higher resolution which will replace ERA-Interim, considered to be the best reanalysis over Greenland until now. However, so far very little is known about the performance of ERA5 when compared to ERA-Interim over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). This study shows (1) that ERA5 improves not significantly the ERA-Interim comparison with near-surface climate observations over GrIS, (2) polar regional climate models (e.g. MAR) are still a useful tool to study the GrIS climate compared to ERA5, in particular in summer, and (3) that MAR results are not sensitive to the forcing used at its lateral boundaries (ERA5 or ERA-Interim).",

        "abstract": "Climate reanalyses provide key information to calibrate proxy records in regions with scarce direct observations. The climate reanalysis used to perform a proxy calibration should accurately reproduce the local climate variability. Here we present a regional scale evaluation of meteorological parameters using ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalyses compared to in-situ observations from 13 automatic weather stations (AWS), located in the southern Antarctic Peninsula and Ellsworth Land, Antarctica. Both reanalyses seem to perform better in the escarpment area (>1000 m a.s.l) than on the coast. A significant improvement is observed in the performance of ERA5 over ERA-Interim. ERA5 is highly accurate, representing the magnitude and variability of near-surface air temperature and wind regimes. The higher spatial and temporal resolution provided by ERA5 reduces significantly the cold coastal biases identified in ERA-Interim and increases the accuracy representing the wind direction and wind speed in the escarpment. The slight underestimation in the wind speed obtained from the reanalyses could be attributed to an interplay of topographic factors and the effect of local wind regimes. Three sites in this region are highlighted for their potential for ice core studies. These sites are likely to provide accurate proxy calibrations for future palaeoclimatic reconstructions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF's)\nnext-generation reanalysis ERA5 provides many improvements, but it\nalso confronts the community with a “big data” challenge. Data\nstorage requirements for ERA5 increase by a factor of ∼80 \ncompared with the ERA-Interim reanalysis, introduced a decade ago.\nConsidering the significant increase in resources required for\nworking with the new ERA5 data set, it is important to assess its\nimpact on Lagrangian transport simulations. To quantify the\ndifferences between transport simulations using ERA5 and ERA-Interim\ndata, we analyzed comprehensive global sets of 10-day forward\ntrajectories for the free troposphere and the stratosphere for the\nyear 2017. The new ERA5 data have a considerable impact on the\nsimulations. Spatial transport deviations between ERA5 and\nERA-Interim trajectories are up to an order of magnitude larger than\nthose caused by parameterized diffusion and subgrid-scale wind\nfluctuations after 1 day and still up to a factor of 2–3 larger\nafter 10 days. Depending on the height range, the spatial\ndifferences between the trajectories map into deviations as large as\n3 K in temperature, 30 % in specific humidity, 1.8 % in potential\ntemperature, and 50 % in potential vorticity after 1 day. Part of\nthe differences between ERA5 and ERA-Interim is attributed to the better\nspatial and temporal resolution of the ERA5 reanalysis, which allows for\na better representation of convective updrafts, gravity waves,\ntropical cyclones, and other meso- to synoptic-scale features of the\natmosphere. Another important finding is that ERA5 trajectories\nexhibit significantly improved conservation of potential temperature\nin the stratosphere, pointing to an improved consistency of ECMWF's\nforecast model and observations that leads to smaller data\nassimilation increments. We conducted a number of downsampling\nexperiments with the ERA5 data, in which we reduced the numbers of\nmeteorological time steps, vertical levels, and horizontal grid\npoints. Significant differences remain present in the transport\nsimulations, if we downsample the ERA5 data to a resolution similar\nto ERA-Interim. This points to substantial changes of the forecast\nmodel, observations, and assimilation system of ERA5 in addition to\nimproved resolution. A comparison of two Lagrangian trajectory\nmodels allowed us to assess the readiness of the codes and workflows\nto handle the comprehensive ERA5 data and to demonstrate the\nconsistency of the simulation results. Our results will help to\nguide future Lagrangian transport studies attempting to navigate the\nincreased computational complexity and leverage the considerable\nbenefits and improvements of ECMWF's new ERA5 data set.",

        "abstract": "Output from meteorological reanalyses are used extensively in both academia and industry for modelling wind power. Recently, the first batch of the new ERA5 reanalysis was released. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of ERA5 and MERRA-2 (a commonly used reanalysis today) in terms of modelling i) the aggregated wind generation in five different countries and ii) the generation for 1051 individual wind turbines in Sweden. The modelled wind power generation was compared to measurements. In conclusion, ERA5 performs better than MERRA-2 in all analysed aspects; correlations are higher, mean absolute and root mean square errors are in average around 20% lower and distributions of both hourly data and changes in hourly data are more similar to those for measurements. It is also shown that the uncertainty related to long-term correction (using one year of measurements and reanalysis data to predict the energy production during the remaining 1–5 years) is 20% lower for ERA5. In fact, using one year sample data and ERA5 gives slightly more accurate estimates than using two years of sample data and MERRA-2. Additionally, a new metric for quantifying the system size and dispersion of wind farms is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the progress made by two new reanalyses in the estimation of surface irradiance: ERA5, the new global reanalysis from the ECMWF, and COSMO-REA6, the regional reanalysis from the DWD for Europe. Daily global horizontal irradiance data were evaluated with 41 BSRN stations worldwide, 294 stations in Europe, and two satellite-derived products (NSRDB and SARAH). ERA5 achieves a moderate positive bias worldwide and in Europe of +4.05  W / m 2 and +4.54  W / m 2 respectively, which entails a reduction in the average bias ranging from 50% to 75% compared to ERA-Interim and MERRA-2. This makes ERA5 comparable with satellite-derived products in terms of the mean bias in most inland stations, but ERA5 results degrade in coastal areas and mountains. The bias of ERA5 varies with the cloudiness, overestimating under cloudy conditions and slightly underestimating under clear-skies, which suggests a poor prediction of cloud patterns and leads to larger absolute errors than that of satellite-based products. In Europe, the regional COSMO-REA6 underestimates in most stations (MBE = −5.29  W / m 2 ) showing the largest deviations under clear-sky conditions, which is most likely caused by the aerosol climatology used. Above 45°N the magnitude of the bias and absolute error of COSMO-REA6 are similar to ERA5 while it outperforms ERA5 in the coastal areas due to its high-resolution grid (6.2 km). We conclude that ERA5 and COSMO-REA6 have reduced the gap between reanalysis and satellite-based data, but further development is required in the prediction of clouds while the spatial grid of ERA5 (31 km) remains inadequate for places with high variability of surface irradiance (coasts and mountains). Satellite-based data should be still used when available, but having in mind their limitations, ERA5 is a valid alternative for situations in which satellite-based data are missing (polar regions and gaps in times series) while COSMO-REA6 complements ERA5 in Central and Northern Europe mitigating the limitations of ERA5 in coastal areas.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the implications of recent advances in global climate modelling for simulating storm surges. Following the ERA-Interim (0.75° × 0.75°) global climate reanalysis, in 2018 the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts released its successor, the ERA5 (0.25° × 0.25°) reanalysis. Using the Global Tide and Surge Model, we analyse eight historical storm surge events driven by tropical—and extra-tropical cyclones. For these events we extract wind fields from the two reanalysis datasets and compare these against satellite-based wind field observations from the Advanced SCATterometer. The root mean squared errors in tropical cyclone wind speed reduce by 58% in ERA5, compared to ERA-Interim, indicating that the mean sea-level pressure and corresponding strong 10-m winds in tropical cyclones greatly improved from ERA-Interim to ERA5. For four of the eight historical events we validate the modelled storm surge heights with tide gauge observations. For Hurricane Irma, the modelled surge height increases from 0.88 m with ERA-Interim to 2.68 m with ERA5, compared to an observed surge height of 2.64 m. We also examine how future advances in climate modelling can potentially further improve global storm surge modelling by comparing the results for ERA-Interim and ERA5 against the operational Integrated Forecasting System (0.125° × 0.125°). We find that a further increase in model resolution results in a better representation of the wind fields and associated storm surges, especially for small size tropical cyclones. Overall, our results show that recent advances in global climate modelling have the potential to increase the accuracy of early-warning systems and coastal flood hazard assessments at the global scale.",

        "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau is regarded as the Earth's Third Pole, which is the source region of several major rivers that impact more 20% the world population. This high-altitude region is reported to have been undergoing much greater rate of weather changes under global warming, but the existing reanalysis products are inadequate for depicting the state of the atmosphere, particularly with regard to the amount of precipitation and its diurnal cycle. An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system based on the limited-area Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was evaluated for use in developing a regional reanalysis over the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding regions. A 3-month prototype reanalysis over the summer months (June-August) of 2015 using WRF-EnKF at a 30-km grid spacing to assimilate nonradiance observations from the Global Telecommunications System was developed and evaluated against independent sounding and satellite observations in comparison to the ERA-Interim and fifth European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ERA5) global reanalysis. Results showed that both the posterior analysis and the subsequent 6- to 12-hr WRF forecasts of the prototype regional reanalysis compared favorably with independent sounding observations, satellite-based precipitation versus those from ERA-Interim and ERA5 during the same period. In particular, the prototype regional reanalysis had clear advantages over the global reanalyses of ERA-Interim and ERA5 in the analysis accuracy of atmospheric humidity, as well as in the subsequent downscale-simulated precipitation intensity, spatial distribution, diurnal evolution, and extreme occurrence.",

        "abstract": "Precipitable water vapor (PWV) content detection is vital to heavy rain prediction; up to now, lots of different measuring methods and devices are developed to observe PWV. In general, these methods can be divided into two categories, ground-based or space-based. In this study, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, compare retrieved atmosphere parameters by different RO (radio occultation) observations, like FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (Formosa Satellite-3 and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) and FY3C (China Feng Yun 3C), and assess retrieved PWV precision with a radiosonde. Besides, we interpolate PWV from NWP (numerical weather prediction) reanalysis data for more comparison and analysis with RO. Specifically, ground-based GNSS is of high precision and continuous availability to monitor PWV distribution; in our paper, we show cases to validate and compare GNSS retrieving PWV with a radiosonde. Except GNSS PWV, we give two different radio occultation sounding results, COSMIC and FY3C, to validate the precision to monitor PWV from space in a global area. FY3C results containing Beidou (China Beidou Global Satellite Navigation System) radio occultation events need to be emphasized. So, in our study, we get the retrieved atmospheric profiles from GPS and Beidou radio occultation observations and derive atmosphere PWV by a variational retrieval method based on these data over a global area. Besides, other space-based methods, such as microwave satellite, are also useful in detecting PWV distribution situations in a global area from space; in this study, we present a case of retrieved PWV using microwave satellite observation. NWP reanalysis data ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ERA-Interim and the new-generation reanalysis data ERA5 provide global grid atmosphere parameters, like surface temperature, different-level pressures, and precipitable water. We show cases of retrieved PWV and validate the precision with radiosonde results and compare new reanalysis dataset ERA5 with ERA-Interim, finding that ERA5 can get higher precision-retrieved atmosphere parameters and PWV. In the end, from our comparison, we find that the retrieved PWV from RO (FY3C and COSMIC) and ECMWF reanalysis data (ERA-Interim and ERA5) have a high positive correlation and that almost all values exceed 0.9, compare retrieved PWV with a radiosonde, and find that whether it is RO and ECMWF reanalysis data, ground-based GNSS, or microwave satellite, they all show small biases.",

        "abstract": "Snowfall data are vital in calculating the surface mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), where in-situ and satellite measurements are sparse at synoptic timescales. CloudSat data are used to construct Antarctic snowfall data at synoptic timescales to compensate for the sparseness of synoptic snowfall data on the AIS and to better understand its surface mass balance. Synoptic CloudSat snowfall data are evaluated by comparison with daily snow accumulation measurements from ten automatic weather stations (AWSs) and the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts climate reanalysis (ERA5) snowfall. Synoptic snowfall data were constructed based on the CloudSat measurements within a radius of 1.41◦. The results show that reconstructed CloudSat snowfall at daily and two-day resolutions cover about 28% and 29% of the area of the AIS, respectively. Daily CloudSat snowfall and AWS snow accumulation have similar trends at all stations. While influenced by stronger winds, >73.3% of extreme snow accumulation events correspond to snowfall at eight stations. Even if the CloudSat snowfall data have not been assimilated into the ERA5 dataset, the synoptic CloudSat snowfall data are almost identical to the daily ERA5 snowfall with only small biases (average root mean square error and mean absolute error < 3.9 mm/day). Agreement among the three datasets suggests that the CloudSat data can provide reliable synoptic snowfall data in most areas of the AIS. The ERA5 dataset captures a large number of extreme snowfall events at all AWSs, with capture rates varying from 56% to 88%. There are still high uncertainties in ERA5. Nevertheless, the result suggests that ERA5 can be used to represent actual snowfall events on the AIS at synoptic timescale.",

        "abstract": "Soil moisture is a key variable in the process of land–atmosphere energy and water exchange. Currently, there are a large number of operational satellite-derived soil moisture products and reanalysis soil moisture products available. However, due to the lack of in situ soil moisture measurements over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), their accuracy and applicability are unclear. Based on the in situ measurements of the soil moisture observing networks established at Maqu, Naqu, Ali, and Shiquanhe (Sq) by the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environmental Resources, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Twente over the TP, the accuracy and reliability of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture version 4.4 (ESA CCI SM v4.4) soil moisture products and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) soil moisture product were evaluated. The spatiotemporal distributions and interannual variations of the soil moisture were analyzed. Further, the climatological soil moisture changing trends across the TP were explored. The results show that with regard to the whole plateau, the combined product performs the best (unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) = 0.043 m3/m3, R = 0.66), followed by the active product (ubRMSE = 0.048 m3/m3, R = 0.62), the passive product (ubRMSE = 0.06 m3/m3, R = 0.61), and the ERA5 soil moisture product (ubRMSE = 0.067 m3/m3, R = 0.52). Considering the good spatiotemporal data continuity of the ERA5 soil moisture product, the ERA5 soil moisture data from 1979 to 2018 were used to analyze the climatological soil moisture changing trend for the entire TP surface. It was found that there was an increasing trend of soil moisture across the TP, which was consistent with the overall trends of increasing precipitation and decreasing evaporation. Moreover, the shrinkage of the cryosphere in conjunction with the background TP warming presumably contribute to soil moisture change.",

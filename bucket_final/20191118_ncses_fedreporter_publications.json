        "abstract": "Here, we report the results of an outcomes evaluation of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs at the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). Since the programs' inception, assessments of the SBIR/STTR programs at several federal agencies have utilized surveys of former grantees as the primary source of data. Response rates have typically been low, making non-response bias a potential threat to the validity of some of these studies' results. Meanwhile, the availability of large publicly-available datasets continues to grow and methods of text mining and linking databases continue to improve. By linking NIGMS grant funding records, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data, and business intelligence databases, we explored innovation, commercialization and survival for recipients of NIGMS SBIR/STTR funding. In doing so, we were able to more completely assess several key outcomes of the NIGMS SBIR/STTR program. Our evaluation demonstrated that the NIGMS program performed above baseline expectations along all dimensions, and comparably to other federal agency SBIR/STTR grant programs. In addition, we show that the use of extant data increasingly is a viable, less expensive, and more reliable approach to gathering data for evaluation studies.",

        "abstract": "With growth in the field of dissemination and implementation (D&I) research, there has been growth in capacity building, with many training opportunities. As such, it is important to continue to evaluate D&I research training programs. This paper reports the results of an evaluation of the Implementation Research Institute (IRI), a R25 funded by the National Institute of Mental Health with additional funding by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The fourth cohort also had a supplement from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Using bibliometrics data, we report on a quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study assessing whether the rates of scholarly productivity in D&I science of IRI fellows (those who applied and were accepted to the training) were greater than those who applied but were not accepted to IRI. Our findings show that Selected Applicants' odds of publishing in implementation science were higher for earlier alumni, starting at 12% 1 year out and increasing to 94% for those who were 4 years out from starting training. Chances for Non-Selected Applicants remained relatively stable, starting at 47% at 1 year and going to 33% at 4 years since their application, a pattern that was stable even after controlling for demographic characteristics. These results support the hypothesis that IRI is increasing the D&I research productivity of those selected to the program, and that our fellows are advancing the field of D&I compared to those investigators not selected to our institute. Our finding also indicates the importance of a 2-year training.",

        "abstract": "Data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on March 5, 2019 showed that Staph aureus infections are a major problem in the United States, with 119,000 infections and almost 20,000 deaths in 2017. Rates of decline for hospital-onset MRSA have slowed since 2012 and the United States is not on track for meeting the 2015 U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services’ goal of a 50% reduction by 2020. There is a need for improved standards for control of dangerous pathogens. Currently, the World Health Organization’s recommendation of preoperatively screening patients for Staph aureus has not become a standard of care in the United States.The U.S. Veterans Health Administration also released data which found a much larger decrease in hospital-onset MRSA infections as opposed to hospital-onset MSSA using various infectious disease bundles that all included universal MRSA surveillance and isolation for MRSA carriers. These results mirror the results obtained by the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. These findings support the contention that the marked decline in hospital-onset MRSA infections observed in these studies is due to interventions which are specifically targeted towards MRSA.A case is made that concerns with the integrity of healthcare policy research, along with industrial conflicts-of-interest have inhibited effective formulation of infectious disease policy in the United States. Because MRSA has become endemic in the general U.S. population (approximately 2%), the author advocates that universal facility-wide screening of MRSA on admission be included in infection prevention bundles used at U.S. hospital.",

        "abstract": "Firearm injuries are the second-leading cause of death for US children and adolescents (ages 1-18). This analysis quantified the federal dollars granted to research for the leading US causes of death for this age group in 2008-17. Several federal data sources were queried. On average, in the study period, $88 million per year was granted to research motor vehicle crashes, the leading cause of death in this age group. Cancer, the third-leading cause of mortality, received $335 million per year. In contrast, $12 million-only thirty-two grants, averaging $597 in research dollars per death-went to firearm injury prevention research among children and adolescents. According to a regression analysis, funding for pediatric firearm injury prevention was only 3.3 percent of what would be predicted by mortality burden, and that level of funding resulted in fewer scientific articles than predicted. A thirtyfold increase in firearm injury research funding focused on this age group, or at least $37 million per year, is needed for research funding to be commensurate with the mortality burden.",

        "abstract": "Objective\nTo identify gaps in postgraduate training and options for building capacity in noncommunicable disease (NCDs) research in Latin America.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a scoping review of postgraduate opportunities in NCDs at top universities in Latin America and of training grants awarded by international funding bodies. Three global university rankings were considered-the QS Ranking, the Shanghai Ranking, and the Times Ranking. Latin American universities appearing in at least two of these were selected. University websites were searched for current graduate programs in biostatistics, epidemiology, global health, health economics, and public health. Information was extracted, summarized, and evaluated to identify any programs focused on NCDs. In addition, seven international funding bodies' websites were searched for training grants.\n\n\nResults\nIn all, 33 universities offering 72 postgraduate programs met the inclusion criteria. One of these programs was exclusively devoted to NCD, and 12 offered NCDs as a dissertation research topic. Only two training grants were awarded to a Latin American institution for NCD capacity building. There are few NCD research training programs in Latin America and only one program exclusively focused on NCDs.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere seem to be few NCD-specific research training programs in Latin America. Leveraging existing programs and expanding those with a focus on NCDs could help enhance NCD research capacity in the region. These initiatives should be supported by international funding agencies through more funding opportunities.",

        "abstract": "The human rights of foreign workers in global supply chains are routinely violated, yet the problem so far has largely evaded a legal solution. Economic analysis shows why domestic tort liability can partially address this problem. Many consumers in developed countries have a lower willingness-to-pay for products produced by global supply chains that systemically subject foreign workers to egregiously dangerous working conditions in gross violation of their human rights. This attribute of consumer demand provides a basis for subjecting the domestic chain leader to domestic tort liability for the bodily injuries suffered by these foreign workers, including those employed by independent suppliers. Chain leaders, like other product sellers, are obligated to warn about foreseeable safety risks that are not known by consumers and would be material to their decision about whether to purchase or use a product. The tort duty also requires sellers to instruct consumers about the ways in which the purchase or use of the product might foreseeably harm third parties. A domestic seller that is the chain leader of a global supply chain would breach this duty by not warning domestic consumers that the product is produced by foreign workers who are systemically subjected to working conditions that are so unsafe as to amount to a gross violation of their human rights. Because the purchase of the product foreseeably exposes foreign workers to this ongoing risk of physical harm, they are protected by the tort duty and can recover for its breach. Causation can be established by the logic of the breached tort duty. If consumers had been warned that the product is produced in such a systemically unsafe work environment, a substantial number of them would not have purchased it – they would instead have purchased the same product at the higher price necessary to protect the foreign workers from these ongoing safety violations. By distorting consumer demand in this manner, the doNote: Sheila Lubetsky Birnbaum Professor of Civil Litigation, New York University School of Law. Copyright 2019Mark A Geistfeld.

In order to establish an interdisciplinary approach for coordinating R&D via funding, it is imperative to discover research trends in the field. In this paper, we apply machine learning methodologies and network analyses to understand how the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) have invested their funding in infectious diseases research utilising an interdisciplinary approach. The purpose of this paper is to use public R&D project data as data and to grasp the research trends of epidemic diseases in the US and EU through scientometric analysis.",

In particular, we demonstrate how multiple funding channels can be studied by bringing together two disparate datasets: UMETRICS, which is based on university payroll and financial records, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), which is one of the most important US survey datasets about the doctoral workforce. We show how it is possible to link data on research funding and the doctorally qualified workforce to describe how many individuals are supported in different disciplines and by different agencies. We outline the potential for more work as the UMETRICS data expands to incorporate more linkages and more access is provided.",

        "abstract": "PrEP is an important and useful HIV prevention strategy, yet awareness remains low among at-risk populations in the United States and elsewhere in the world. As previous studies have shown PrEP awareness to be important to PrEP uptake, understanding approaches to increase PrEP awareness is imperative. The current systematic review provides an overview of published articles and on-going research on PrEP awareness. Using PRISMA guidelines, two published articles and seven on-going research studies were identified that use different approaches to increase PrEP awareness. Findings highlight the need for research to target other at-risk populations and geographic areas. Future research should consider the use of technology and network approaches to assess whether they lead to increased awareness, accurate knowledge, and uptake of PrEP, along with examining which messaging works best for specific targeted, at-risk population(s).ResumenPrEP es una estrategia importante y útil, sin embargo, la concientización dentro de las poblaciones de riesgo en Estados Unidos y en el Mundo, son bajas. Como lo han demostrado estudios anteriores, la concientización del PrEP es importante para el consumo del PrEP, por lo tanto, entender los enfoques para incrementar la concientización del PrEP, es imperativo. El actual sistema de revisión provee algunos artículos publicados e investigación continua sobre la concientización del PrEP. Usando las guías PRISMA, dos artículos publicados y siete estudios de investigación continua, fueron identificados que utilizan diferentes métodos para incrementar la concientización del PrEP. Resultados resaltan la necesidad de investigaciones en poblaciones de riesgo y en áreas geográficas. Futuras investigaciones deberían considerar el uso de tecnología y redes para evaluar si se incremento de la concientización, conocimiento y consume del PrEP, en conjunto con examinar mensajes que funcionan para el objetivo específico, para una población o poblaciones en riesgo.",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the microbiome and its role in immunity, cancer initiation, and cancer progression has evolved significantly over the past century. The \"germ theory of cancer\" was first proposed in the early 20th century, and shortly thereafter the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, and later Fusobacterium nucleatum, were implicated in the development of gastric and colorectal cancers, respectively. However, with the development of reliable mouse models and affordable sequencing technologies, the most fascinating aspect of the microbiome-cancer relationship, where microbes undermine cancer immune surveillance and indirectly promote oncogenesis, has only recently been described. In this review, we highlight the essential role of the microbiome in immune system development and maturation. We review how microbe-induced immune activation promotes oncogenesis, focusing particularly on pancreatic carcinogenesis, and show that modulation of the microbiome augments the anti-cancer immune response and enables successful immunotherapy against pancreatic cancer.",

        "abstract": "To what extent is scientific research related to societal needs? To answer this crucial question systematically we need to contrast indicators of research priorities with indicators of societal needs. We focus on rice research and technology between 1983 and 2012. We combine quantitative methods that allow investigation of the relation between ‘revealed’ research priorities and ‘revealed’ societal demands, measured respectively by research output (publications) and national accounts of rice use and farmers’ and consumers’ rice-related needs. We employ new bibliometric data, methods and indicators to identify countries’ main rice research topics (priorities) from publications. For a panel of countries, we estimate the relation between revealed research priorities and revealed demands. We find that, across countries and time, societal demands explain a country's research trajectory to a limited extent. Some research priorities are nicely aligned to societal demands, confirming that science is partly related to societal needs. However, we find a relevant number of misalignments between the focus of rice research and revealed demands, crucially related to human consumption and nutrition. We discuss some implications for research policy.",

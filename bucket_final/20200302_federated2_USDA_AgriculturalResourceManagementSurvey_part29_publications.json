        "abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure the profit impacts of adopting input and output risk management tools at the farm level. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis examines three years of farm-level data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) that include detailed questions on the adoption of risk management tools. Propensity score matching is used to control for the endogeneity of adoption decisions, and the profit impacts are estimated based on the matched dataset. Findings - The adoption of input price risk management tools improves farm-level profits by 13-17 percent. Originality/value - This is the first paper which examines the profit impacts of risk management tools while controlling for the endogeneity of adoption.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Missing values present a prevalent problem in the analysis of establishment survey data. Multivariate imputation algorithms (which are used to fill in missing observations) tend to have the common limitation that imputations for continuous variables are sampled from Gaussian distributions. This limitation is addressed here through the use of robust marginal transformations. Specifically, kernel-density and empirical distribution-type transformations are discussed and are shown to have favorable properties when used for imputation of complex survey data. Although such techniques have wide applicability (i.e., they may be easily applied in conjunction with a wide array of imputation techniques), the proposed methodology is applied here with an algorithm for imputation in the USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey. Data analysis and simulation results are used to illustrate the specific advantages of the robust methods when compared to the fully parametric techniques and to other relevant techniques such as predictive mean matching. To summarize, transformations based upon parametric densities are shown to distort several data characteristics in circumstances where the parametric model is ill fit; however, no circumstances are found in which the transformations based upon parametric models outperform the nonparametric transformations. As a result, the transformation based upon the empirical distribution (which is the most computationally efficient) is recommended over the other transformation procedures in practice.",

        "abstract": "Farm households are economic agents whose income is derived from farm, off-farm, and government sources. This article uses farm-level data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and recent advances in the econometric theory of dynamic pseudo-panels to show that farm households consume various sources of income differently at the margin. Particular attention is given to a specific type of lump-sum government transfer payment intended to be decoupled from (independent of) farm production decisions. The results suggest that relatively decoupled government subsidies have a greater marginal effect on farm household consumption than subsidies that are tied to market conditions.

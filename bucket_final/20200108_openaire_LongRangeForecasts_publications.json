        "abstract": "Using the National Center for Atmospheric Research/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCAR/NCEP) reanalyses and the daily Pacific North American (PNA) index values from the Climate Prediction Center from 1 January 1950 to 31 December 2016, the utility of the Bering Sea Rule (BSR) and the East Asia Rule (EAR) for making forecasts in the two-to-four-week time frame for the central USA region is examined. It is demonstrated using autocorrelation and Fourier transforms that there may be a degree of predictability in this time frame using the PNA, another teleconnection index, or some variation of them. Neither the BSR nor EAR based forecasts showed skill over climatology in the traditional sense, but using signal detection techniques these indexes were skillful at predicting the onset of anomalous temperature conditions (greater than two standard deviations) in the central USA. The BSR generally produced better results that the EAR and formulae for each index are proposed. Three case studies demonstrate the efficacy of these indexes for forecasting temperatures in the central USA. Then, it is proposed that the success of these indexes is likely due to a strong, quasistationary, and persistent Rossby wave train in the Pacific teleconnection region.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant, steady improvements in the skill of medium-range weather predictionsystems over the past several decades, the accuracy of these forecasts are occasionally very poor.These forecast failures are referred to as “busts” or “dropouts”. The lack of a clear explanationfor bust events limits the development and implementation of strategies designed to reduce theiroccurrence. This study seeks to explore a flow regime where forecast busts occur over Europe inassociation with mesoscale convective systems over North America east of the Rocky Mountains.Our investigation focuses on error growth in the European Centre for Medium-Range WeatherForecasting’s (ECMWF’s) global model during the summer 2015 PECAN (Plains Elevated Convectionat Night) experiment. Observations suggest that a close, but varied interrelationship can occurbetween long-lived, propagating, mesoscale convection systems over the Great Plains and Rossbywave packets. Aloft, the initial error occurs in the ridge of the wave and then propagates downstreamas an amplifying Rossby wave packet producing poor forecasts in middle latitudes and, in somecases, the Arctic. Our results suggest the importance of improving the representation of organizeddeep convection in numerical models, particularly for long-lived mesoscale convective systems thatproduce severe weather and propagate near the jet stream.",

        "abstract": "The past developments in the predictability of weather and climate are discussed from the point of view of nonlinear dynamical systems. The problems ahead for long-range predictability extending into the climate time scale are also presented. The sensitive dependence of chaos on initial conditions and the imperfections in the models limit reliable predictability of the instantaneous state of the weather to less than 10 days in present-day operational forecasts. The existence of slowly varying components such as the sea surface temperature, soil moisture, snow cover, and sea ice may provide basis for predicting certain aspects of climate at long range. The regularly varying nonlinear oscillations, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, monsoon intraseasonal oscillations, and El Niño-Southern Oscillation, are also possible sources of extended-range predictability at the climate time scale. A prediction model based on phase space reconstruction has demonstrated that monsoon intraseasonal oscillation can be better predicted at long leads.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a general estimation and inference framework to study how different levels of program participation affect participants’ outcomes. We decompose differences in the outcome distribution into (i) a structure effect, arising due to the conditional outcome distributions given covariates associated with different levels of participation; and (ii) a composition effect, arising due to differences in the distributions of observable characteristics. These counterfactual differences are equivalent to the multivalued treatment effects for the treated under a conditional independence assumption. We propose efficient nonparametric estimators based on propensity score weighting together with uniform inference theory. We employ our methods to study the effects of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs on participants’ earnings. We find that heterogeneity in levels of program participation is an important dimension to evaluate the WIA and other social programs in which participation varies. The results of this paper, both theoretically and empirically, provide rigorous assessment of intervention programs and relevant suggestions to improve their performance and cost-effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "This study includes the likelihood of finding a job and retaining employment as well as eligibility for unemployment benefits to estimate the return on investment (ROI) for both job training and intensive services programs. The augmented ROI for job training programs and intensive job services from California One-Stop Centers are positive. This suggests that these programs do provide benefits. The estimated augmented ROI for individuals enrolled in job training programs and intensive job services are similar. In contrast, traditional approaches that omit important employment characteristics significantly overestimate the ROI. Monte Carlo simulations show that changing program costs affect the augmented ROI for training programs but have minimal impact on the augmented ROI for intensive services.",

Earnings gains for Dislocated Worker program participants are appreciably smaller, although these participants do experience employment gains.JEL codesI38, J08, J24",

In practice, however, differences and tensions between these movements—such as their methods and standards for assembling and analyzing data, and the strategic timing and use of this information to influence policy and hold public managers accountable for performance—could limit their success. Using cases and empirical studies, this article considers questions about what should count as evidence, how it should be communicated, who should judge the quality and reliability of evidence and performance information, and how to achieve a balance between processes that produce rigorous information for decision making and those that foster democratic governance and accountability.

        "abstract": "The college participation rates of African Americans and Latinos continue to lag behind those of other racial and ethnic groups in the United States, despite the efforts of financial aid and affirmative action policies. Two recent federal policies that are “work-first” in nature threaten to further exacerbate racial and ethnic disparities in college access. This article examines the complex ways in which the 1996 welfare reform and the 1998 Workforce Investment Act differentially affect opportunities for college enrollment among disadvantaged adults. Utilizing national and state-level data, the authors argue that both policies restrict access to postsecondary education through the implementation of their guiding philosophy, “work-first,” which emphasizes rapid job placement as the strategy of choice in achieving stable employment and moving out of poverty. These policies have reduced the size of the clientele receiving welfare and restricted access to education and training for those who remain on the rol...",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe persistent instability of the agricultural sector is the fundamental premise of most agricultural policy. Yet no research has ever quantified the aggregate dynamics of individual farms in the US. This article is the first to combine the US Census of Agriculture with the Agricultural Resource Management Survey to observe the dynamics of nearly 1.5 million farms. The data reveal substantial variation in farm size expansion and contraction. Most of this variation is unobservable in the sector totals reported by the US Department of Agriculture each year. The distribution of agricultural subsidies suggests that subsidies become more important as farms get smaller and may play a role in slowing farm size contraction.",

        "abstract": "Farms growing rice changed significantly over the past two decades in terms of operation size and the ways in which rice is produced. As the total number of farms growing rice declined (from 9,627 in 1997 to 5,591 in 2012), total U.S. planted rice acres also dropped at an annual average rate of about 0.75 percent between 1995 and 2017. U.S. farms growing rice expanded that acreage more than 50 percent between 2000 and 2013 to an average of 600 acres per farm. Farm size increased most in the South where larger farms were able to take advantage of size economies. The most significant change in rice production technologies from 2000 to 2013 was the introduction and adoption of new rice seed varieties. Southern rice producers increasingly planted hybrid and non-genetically modified herbicide-tolerant seed. Precision farming technologies also proliferated, especially the use of yield monitors and guidance systems for tractors and other self-propelled machines. The adoption of new technologies in rice farming pushed per-acre production costs higher, but rice yields also increased, offsetting much of the higher costs. U.S. rice production saw an estimated productivity gain of 29 percent from 2000 to 2013, about 2.2 percent annually. Structural and productivity changes on U.S. farms growing rice benefited U.S. domestic rice consumers by helping to keep prices low and enhanced the competitiveness of U.S. rice producers in global markets.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - To identify periods of severe stress, and potentially take action to avoid or dampen their negative effects, lenders and policymakers need accurate and reliable data on US farm debt supply and credit needs. The purpose of this paper is to assess the current availability of information on US farm debt as well as its accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - A review of the farm debt information and survey methodology of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). Findings - This manuscript examines several potential issues involving the debt and lender data within ARMS. First, the empirical results indicate that there is an informational break in ARMS beginning in 2000. Second, the paper presents evidence that the overall level of debt reported by USDA is not consistent with information reported by lenders for other regulatory sources. Finally, the paper proposes a modification of the debt question to improve the data collection. Originality/value - The paper offers an external review of farm debt information in ARMS.",

        "abstract": "In an effort to increase response rates, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) began experimenting with monetary incentives in 2004. Follow-up assessments of the monetary incentive in 2005 demonstrated that ATM cash cards are beneficial in increasing Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase III (ARMS III) response rates and decreasing survey costs; however, it is unknown which sampled units would have responded without the incentive. This paper discusses the use of data mining to identify likely ARMS III respondents. A series of models were built using 2002 Census of Agriculture data to predict several years of ARMS III sample respondents before (2003-2004) incentives were introduced. These models were applied to the years after incentives were introduced (2005-2007) to confirm that they continued to identify likely respondents. The respondent prediction models discussed in this report enable NASS to flag persons likely to respond given no incentive. Providing incentives to these respondents requires substantial costs, but likely does not increase overall response rates. In addition, if providing them incentives does increase response rates, it may increase them in such a way that NASS estimates are further biased if only more of the same type of operations opt to respond.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the feasibility of preparing a statement of owner equity (SOE) and statement of cash flows (SOCF) for the agricultural sector. Also, the use of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to collect data needed to supplement the US farm sector accounts to prepare a sector SOE and SOCF is discussed. Design/methodology/approach - An SOE and SOCF for an individual producer was used to provide an example format for preparing an SOE and SOCF for the agricultural sector and to identify the data needed from the ARMS survey to supplement farm sector accounts. Findings - The format and data needed to prepare a sector SOE and SOCF were identified and the feasibility of the collection of that data using current ERS/USDA survey collection methods would provide the data needed to prepare the statements. However, the use of two independent data collection authorities to collect the data would result in an agricultural sector SOE and SOCF that would not reconcile. Originality/value - The paper initiates a dialog of possible alternatives available to the ERS/USDA and researchers concerning data needed and data sources available to prepare an agricultural sector SOE and SOCF, as well as the shortfalls and inaccuracies that would result.",

        "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) have been widely used to study socioecological systems. They are useful for studying such systems because of their ability to incorporate micro-level behaviors among interacting agents, and to understand emergent phenomena due to these interactions. However, ABMs are inherently stochastic and require proper handling of uncertainty. We propose a simulation framework based on quantitative uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to build parsimonious ABMs that serve two purposes: exploration of the outcome space to simulate low-probability but high-consequence events that may have significant policy implications, and explanation of model behavior to describe the system with higher accuracy. The proposed framework is applied to the problem of modeling farmland conservation resulting in land use change. We employ output variance decomposition based on quasi-random sampling of the input space and perform three computational experiments. First, we perform uncertainty analysis to improve model legitimacy, where the distribution of results informs us about the expected value that can be validated against independent data, and provides information on the variance around this mean as well as the extreme results. In our last two computational experiments, we employ sensitivity analysis to produce two simpler versions of the ABM. First, input space is reduced only to inputs that produced the variance of the initial ABM, resulting in a model with output distribution similar to the initial model. Second, we refine the value of the most influential input, producing a model that maintains the mean of the output of initial ABM but with less spread. These simplifications can be used to 1) efficiently explore model outcomes, including outliers that may be important considerations in the design of robust policies, and 2) conduct explanatory analysis that exposes the smallest number of inputs influencing the steady state of the modeled system.",

        "abstract": "This essay discusses nonunion employment contracts. It describes several important contract doctrines that have significantly eroded the once virtually irrefutable employment-at-will presumption. Two factors appear to determine whether employees receive protection against discharge: (1) jurisdictional variation among liberal, conservative and centrist states, and (2) the definiteness and specificity of any alleged assurances of job security. Recently, scholars have also debated the normative question of whether the at-will rule is a desirable default, offering various economic arguments in support of a just cause regime. The essay questions whether the existence of implicit agreements for career employment justifies making such informal agreements legally enforceable. Workers cognitive limitations and strategic problems such as signaling and adverse selection produce ambiguous behavioral predictions, and thus they too provide an uncertain basis for reform. A nascent empirical literature has begun to provide valuable information about actual contract practices. Thus, for example, arguments based on adverse selection must confront the inconvenient fact that a significant number of employers (government agencies, unionized firms, and about 15% of nonunion employers) contract for legally enforceable just cause protection. Other important empirical work has raised doubts about the extent of workers legal knowledge. The essay concludes that more and better evidence on these questions is needed to justify displacing the current at-will default.",

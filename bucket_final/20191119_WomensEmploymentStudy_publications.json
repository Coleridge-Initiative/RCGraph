        "abstract": "Gender-based violence is associated with an array of negative health outcomes for women and limits their opportunities to fully participate in society. Only recently have studies begun to explore the interconnectedness of emotional, physical and sexual gender-based violence. This qualitative study sought to understand how men and women in Senegal perceive various forms of gender-based violence, their connections, and who could best promote change among perpetrators of violence. Community focus group discussions that used structured exercises adapted from Participatory Learning and Action group activities were carried out in urban and rural settings in seven regions of Senegal. Groups were sampled for maximum variation within rural and urban settings in each region (n = 28 groups and n = 267 participants). Male and female groups in both urban and rural settings described each form of violence similarly. Examples of emotional violence centered around home finances, neglect, and dependency. Emotional violence between male and female spouses escalated to physically and sexually violent behaviors, uniquely directed at women and girls. Physical violence was described in two levels: acceptable and unacceptable. Sexual violence was described as common within households but unreported. Economic considerations cross-cut each form of violence. The findings from this study contribute to conceptual definitions and understandings of GBV from a community perspective to better inform programmatic and communication approaches for the reduction of GBV in Senegal. Challenges will remain until the global community can more effectively address equitable access to financial resources among the world’s poorest.",

However, little evidence exists as to why they experienced housing instability, although they were stably housed at other times. By applying hybrid models to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data, this study estimates the effects of potential household-level predictors on the likelihood of experiencing housing instability. The results show that changes in family employment structure, job insecurity, automobile ownership, and the number of adult family members within a household correlate with housing instability after controlling for changes in household income and housing costs. Moreover, I find that households with children are particularly vulnerable to housing instability. These results contribute to identifying valid household-level predictors of housing instability and developing preventive policy interventions that help unsubsidized low-in...",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRising food bank use in the past decade in the UK raises questions about whether food insecurity has increased. Using the 2016 Food and You survey, we describe the magnitude and severity of the problem, examine characteristics associated with severity of food insecurity, and examine how vulnerability has changed among low-income households by comparing 2016 data to the 2004 Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Food and You survey is a representative survey of adults living in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (n=3118). Generalised ordered logistic regression models were used to examine how socioeconomic characteristics related to severity of food insecurity. Coarsened exact matching was used to match respondents to respondents in the 2004 survey. Logistic regression models were used to examine if food insecurity rose between survey years.\n\n\nRESULTS\n20.7% (95% CI 18.7% to 22.8%) of adults experienced food insecurity in 2016, and 2.72% (95% CI 2.07% to 3.58%) were severely food insecure. Younger age, non-white ethnicity, low education, disability, unemployment, and low income were all associated with food insecurity, but only the latter three characteristics were associated with severe food insecurity. Controlling for socioeconomic variables, the probability of low-income adults being food insecure rose from 27.7% (95% CI 24.8% to 30.6 %) in 2004 to 45.8% (95% CI 41.6% to 49.9%) in 2016. The rise was most pronounced for people with disabilities.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFood insecurity affects economically deprived groups in the UK, but unemployment, disability and low income are characteristics specifically associated with severe food insecurity. Vulnerability to food insecurity has worsened among low-income adults since 2004, particularly among those with disabilities.",

At follow-up, 37.3% had no contact with the perpetrator, 22.7% had stayed with him, and 39.8% had “forced” contact. Almost half of the sample was still subjected to intimate partner violence (IPV). Compared to women with “no contact,” the risk of IPV was 5.9 times higher for women who stayed with the perpetrator, and 10.5 times higher for women with “forced” contact. These results confirm that ending IPV does not depend exclusively on women’s choices.",

Civil rights law is the primary legal mechanism used to address discrimination. Federal civil rights laws have been the subject of wider analyses as a determinant of health as well as a tool to address health disparities. The research on state civil rights laws, while more limited, is growing. This article will highlight a few examples of how some states are using civil rights laws to combat discrimination, particularly in more expansive ways and in the interest of new populations, presenting tools that can target determinants and address the goal of reducing health disparities.",

        "abstract": "Mothers who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) are at increased risk for experiencing workplace instability in the form of absence from paid employment and job loss. In a cross-sectional study, we investigate if experiences of IPV inhibit work stability among low-income women as well as if the receipt of child care subsidies has a moderating effect on the relationship. Using data from the Illinois Families Study, we tested the relationships between IPV, work outcomes, and recipient of child care subsidies in a series of multivariate regressions. Findings indicate IPV is associated with reduced hours worked among low-income mothers and increased unemployment among low-income mothers. However, both of these relationships are moderated by receipt of child care subsidies suggesting that mothers who experience IPV can maintain employment at the same level as women not experiencing IPV with receipt of child care subsidies. Our findings indicate the importance of receiving child care subsidies among low-income mothers and support subsidy accessibility to survivors of IPV. Results of our study are limited in regard to the age of the data, the cross-sectional use of the data, and the lack of a control group that was not receiving any type of government assistance.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nGiven high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization among veterans, along with employment-related difficulties, a better understanding of IPV's implications for employment functioning is needed among post-9/11 veterans, especially male veterans. This study aimed to examine the gender-based associations between IPV victimization types (physical, psychological, and sexual) and employment outcomes (absenteeism, presenteeism, and job satisfaction).\n\n\nMETHOD\nA national sample of male and female post-9/11 veterans completed a survey administered approximately 5.5 years after deployment including IPV victimization and employment measures. This study used data from 407 veterans (52% women) in intimate relationships to examine the associations between IPV victimization and employment outcomes by gender, using regression-based analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSexual IPV was significantly associated with absenteeism and presenteeism for women but not men, and physical IPV was significantly associated with presenteeism for men but not women. There were also marginal associations between psychological IPV and both absenteeism and job satisfaction overall, regardless of gender.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll IPV types were linked to employment functioning for both male and female post-9/11 veterans. These findings can aid in the development of trauma-informed psychosocial intervention efforts for women and men that target employment functioning as well as IPV to help victims of partner violence achieve healthy and stable lifestyles.

        "abstract": "Evictions from rented accommodations are a common pathway to homelessness and can negatively impact the lives of individuals and communities worldwide. There have been only few interventions developed to address evictions, and it is important to first understand factors associated with evictions. This systematic review included all available peer-reviewed articles on the topic published in the international literature from 1900 to 2017 and identified 10 peer-reviewed studies of evictions conducted in the United States, Canada, Amsterdam and Britain. From these studies, four categories of factors associated with evictions were identified. These factors were financial hardships, sociodemographic characteristics, substance use and other health problems. While many studies had large sample sizes, the majority of studies were cross-sectional. Together, our review found that there were several salient factors known to be associated with evictions which may benefit from intervention. However, more prospective studies on evictions and development of interventions are needed.",

        "abstract": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are currently approving Medicaid demonstration projects involving work and community engagement requirements. The fear among public health professionals and policymakers is that these work requirements will disproportionately limit access to health insurance for African-Americans. To investigate these new work requirements for Medicaid, we conducted a systematic review of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the last major welfare program to have such work requirements. We used the ProQuest database and selected scholarly journal studies in English and published between January 1991-August 2018. Our selection strategy yielded 14 eligible studies, eight of which focused on caseload movements and six focused on sanctions. We found that African-Americans entered TANF at a higher rate than Whites, remained on TANF longer, and were subject to sanctions more frequently and stringently than Whites were. These results suggest that African-Americans may disproportionately experience reduced access to care through sanctioning such as lockout periods. Recommended policy changes include prohibiting work activities as a condition of Medicaid coverage, strengthening Medicaid in other ways, combating discriminatory hiring practices, and easing burdensome reporting requirements.",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesAmong children, poor socio-emotional functioning leads to poor health and well-being during childhood and later in life, and so understanding its social determinants is important. This study’s objective is to examine how maternal employment influences children’s socio-emotional outcomes in an Australian sample of families with two biological parents, testing the mediating role of maternal mental health, parenting practices, and parental income.MethodsWe analyze six waves of panel data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n = 7524 children, 29,701 observations) using random-effect models.ResultsChildren of employed mothers display better socio-emotional outcomes than children of non-employed mothers, though the effect magnitude is only moderate. Associations are stronger for internalizing than externalizing problems, and not mediated by parental mental health, parenting practices, or household income.ConclusionsOur findings can inform sociopolitical debates on the social value of maternal labor force participation and its impacts on children. They suggest that incentivizing maternal employment should bear no detrimental consequences on their children’s socio-emotional functioning. The different associations found for children’s internalizing and externalizing problems stress the value of distinguishing these constructs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) is high (54%) in Bangladesh. Moreover, female garment workers report higher rates of IPV and are also vulnerable to workplace violence (WPV). Experience of violence puts women at increased risk of developing depressive symptoms, which are related with low self-esteem, lower life satisfaction and lower productivity. To our knowledge, there has been no previous research on depression among female garment workers and its connections to IPV and WPV in Bangladesh. This paper aims to address this gap by studying the relationship of IPV, WPV and depression among female garment workers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe data for this paper comes from a cross-sectional survey of female garment workers (n = 800) conducted as baseline survey of a quasi-experimental study known as HERrespect. Survey data were collected during September-December, 2016 among randomly selected female garment workers from eight garment factories in and around Dhaka city. Structural equation modelling was conducted to explore the relationship among IPV, WPV and depression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe findings show high rates of any IPV (69%); WPV (73%, experienced or witnessed) and depressive symptomatology (40%) among female garment workers. The analysis of pathways shows that IPV impacts a woman's experience of WPV and work related stress leading to the development of depression; while WPV had direct and mediated pathways to depression. Experience of controlling by their husband leads to WPV and increased work related stress, and thus leads to depression. It also reveals that a worker's ability to mobilize resources in emergency, however, increased self-esteem and reduced work related stress.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study shows the pathways through which experience of IPV and WPV lead to development of depressive symptoms among female garment workers. The link between women's ability to mobilize resources with self-esteem and work related stress indicates the need for socio-economic empowerment of women and may suggest that combined intervention to address IPV and women's empowerment could be successful in dealing with WPV and mental health.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe objective of this paper is to investigate the link between women’s labour force participation and intimate partner violence, using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) across 20 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries between 2010 and 2015. The study contributes to the existing literature by incorporating a macroeconomic dimension to previous framework measuring the risk factors of intimate partner violence. The findings reveal a positive link between employment status and the risk of intimate partner violence, where working women in SSA have 19% higher odds of abuse compared to non-working ones. This result holds robust across sexual, emotional and less severe physical abuse and is particularly relevant for the Eastern and Western parts of SSA. It is further observed that more educated women and those married or started living with their partner at a very early age face higher risk of partner abuse. Similarly, gender discrimination in social institutions and polygyny are important risk factor...",

        "abstract": "More data is needed about the pathways through which intimate partner violence (IPV) impacts the economic well-being of survivors. The current study assesses the moderating influence of social support on the association between economic abuse (EA) and economic hardship. Female participants (n = 435) were recruited to participate in a web-based survey which included standardized measures of EA, other forms of IPV, domains of social support, and economic hardship. Analysis included bivariate and multivariate regression with an investigation into interaction effects.Experiencing EA was significantly correlated with economic hardship, even with extent of physical and emotional IPV controlled. Both tangible and appraisal support had significant negative association with extent of material hardship. Significant interactions between forms of social support and economic abuse were observed. For those at high levels of economic abuse, support had less influence on economic hardship. A mix of direct economic aid, advocacy, education and support could provide a blueprint for addressing the economic hardship experiences of community-dwelling survivors of economic abuse. A comprehensive response to EA requires interventions aimed directly at economically controlling and exploitative tactics, including credit building, individual economic advocacy, and education. Interventions that seek to enhance survivors’ access to social support may be necessary but not sufficient to buffer the impacts of violence on survivors’ economic outcomes.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid increase in women’s labor force participation in Asia, a greater understanding of the impact of maternal employment on parenting and child development in Asia is much needed. The present study examined the concurrent relations between maternal employment status and family characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status/SES, family structure) in Taiwanese families, and the unique relations of maternal employment and family SES to maternal stress, parenting beliefs, and preschoolers’ socioemotional adjustment. In a school-based sample of 511 preschoolers (age range = 4–6 years, 52.9% girls), their mothers, and teachers in Taipei and Taitung, mothers reported their employment status, family characteristics, perceived stress and parenting beliefs. Mothers and teachers rated preschoolers’ adjustment. Results showed that compared to unemployed mothers in Taiwan, employed mothers were more likely to come from families with higher SES and fewer children, and nuclear (vs. extended) families. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. Mothers from lower-SES families reported higher stress and higher endorsement of coercive parenting, and lower endorsement of authoritative parenting than mothers from higher-SES families. Controlling for SES, employed mothers endorsed higher coercive parenting than unemployed mothers. Mothers’ endorsement of authoritative parenting was associated with better child adjustment by mothers’ (but not teachers’) reports, whereas maternal stress and coercive parenting were associated with poorer child adjustment (by mothers’ reports only). In sum, maternal employment was intricately associated with family SES in Taiwanese families, and the two contextual factors shape parenting and child adjustment in different processes.",

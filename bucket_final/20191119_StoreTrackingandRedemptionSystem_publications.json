        "abstract": "Background: Motivated by concern over lack of access to nutritious food in low-income neighborhoods, healthy food financing initiatives have encouraged the introduction of new supermarkets. Extensive research on the association between the food retail environment and nutrition outcomes has shown mixed results. There has been less research specifically on food security outcomes. Objective: We assessed the association between multiple food environment measures and food security for low-income US households. Methods: By using the USDA's nationally representative 2012-2013 Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS; n = 4826 households), which provides unique information about neighborhood- and household-level food retailer access, we quantified cross-sectional associations between food environment characteristics and household-level outcomes, with and without regression controls. Logistic regression analysis was used for binary household food security outcomes. Results: Most households bypassed the nearest retailer to select a primary retailer farther from home. For low-income households, distance to the nearest supermarket and to the primary retailer was not associated with food security. In comparison to shopping with households' own automobile, the odds of being food secure were lower for households that used another automobile (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.90) or other transportation (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.61) to reach the primary retailer. Conclusions: Having a closest supermarket ≤1 mile from home was not associated with household food security. In contrast, the mode of transportation used to access the primary retailer was associated with household food security. In future research, it may be valuable to not only focus on the distance to the nearest supermarket but to investigate the qualities of the food retail environment at distances >1 mile that are most strongly associated with food security outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Where households across income levels shop for food is of central concern within a growing body of research focused on where people live relative to where they shop, what they purchase and eat, and how those choices influence the risk of obesity and chronic disease. We analyzed data from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) using a conditional logit model to determine where participants shop for food to be prepared and eaten at home and how individual and household characteristics of food shoppers interact with store characteristics and distance from home in determining store choice. Store size, whether or not it was a full-service supermarket, and the driving distance from home to the store constituted the three significant main effects on store choice. Overall, participants were more likely to choose larger stores, conventional supermarkets rather than super-centers and other types of stores, and stores closer to home. Interaction effects show that participants receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) were even more likely to choose larger stores. Hispanic participants were more likely than non-Hispanics to choose full-service supermarkets while White participants were more likely to travel further than non-Whites. This study demonstrates the value of explicitly spatial discrete choice models and provides evidence of national trends consistent with previous smaller, local studies.",

Design A pretest–posttest design that compared pantry use at program enrollment and after 6 months of participation while controlling for household, economic, and geographic characteristics. Setting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Food Security Survey: a national telephone survey of SNAP new‐entrant households conducted in 2011–2012. Participants A total of 3,191 households that completed baseline interviews and were still participating in SNAP approximately 6 months later. Main Outcome Measure Received emergency food from pantries in the past 30 days. Analysis Logistic regression analysis of pantry use with SNAP participation and time‐varying household characteristics as independent variables. Statistical significance was assessed using t tests. The authors applied a Bonferroni adjustment to account for multiple comparisons performed. Results Participating in SNAP for 6 months was associated with a decrease in pantry use by 5.2 percentage points (P < .001), representing a 24% reduction (from 21.8% to 16.6%). Conclusions and Implications Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit allotments are sufficient for some households, but 76% of SNAP households that enter the program while using pantries continue to do so about 6 months later, which underscores the need to assess the adequacy of SNAP benefit allotments in ensuring access to sufficient food for a healthy, active life.",

To characterize households’ geographic access to food, street addresses of households and retailers were used to calculate the distances to stores and numbers of retailers in the area. Food purchase behavior was described by the type of store from which respondents purchased most of their groceries, the reasons why they preferred to shop there, typical mode of transportation, and typical travel time and distance to the store. The study found that at least half of SNAP participants have access to one or more supermarkets within close range of their household and do the majority of their food shopping at a supermarket (less than 1% purchase most of their groceries at a convenience store). SNAP households typically bypass nearby stores to use stores far...",

The locations of food pantries were mapped against the map of supermarkets in 47 states and the District of Columbia to identify local areas without supermarkets and the percentage of these areas that have a pantry. Local area population characteristics were used to define subgroups of areas based on poverty level and socioeconomic status of households. The study found that food pantries help to address food access limitations in a sizable percentage of area without supermarkets. About one quarter of census tracts with no supermarkets were found to have at least one food pantry. When considering only high-poverty tracts, 40% of areas without a supermarket had a pantry. The study also found that among areas without supermarkets, pantries tend to be located in areas with ...",

Mean percentage of TFP carried in small/medium stores was 50%. Convenience stores carried 28% of the TFP items. Supermarkets had higher overall quality ratings and quality ratings for fresh and frozen foods compared to small/medium and convenience stores (P<.01).\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE\nAlthough supermarkets carried a large percentage of items surveyed, the number of supermarkets in this region is limited. Community residents with limited transportation to reach supermarkets may experience limited food supply adequacy. Therefore, community-based nutrition interventions should include partnerships with small/medium food retailers while trying to impact residents' food choices within those stores.",

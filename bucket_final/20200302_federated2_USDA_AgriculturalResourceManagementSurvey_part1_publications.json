        "abstract": "This study compares the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households using data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey and the Survey of Consumer Finances. Comparisons are made in terms of income and wealth using parametric and nonparametric tests, regression analyses, and inequality measures. The results show that the economic well-being of households differs based on their degree of involvement in business activities and their life-cycle stages. The main conclusion is that the income of rural residence and intermediate farms is comparable to that of wage-earning nonfarm households, while commercial farms are similar in well-being to nonfarm households with businesses.

We examined how the variability of returns and the flexibility to change or postpone decisions (option value) affects the economic potential of forestry and agroforestry systems to keep private land in production while still providing ecosystem services. A real options analysis examined the impact of flexibility in decision making under agriculture, forestry, and agroforestry and demonstrated that adoption of forestry or agroforestry systems is less feasible than would be predicted by deterministic capital budgeting models.",

        "abstract": "The Authors analyze the challenges created by the digital revolution and the effects on the techniques for the protection of the workers, underlining the absence of a homogeneous concept of work through platforms. The comparative analysis reveals that this form of employment has been sometimes qualified as dependent, sometimes as autonomous. A regulation of the transport activity via electronic platform has been proposed in 2018 in Portugal. The authors offer a critical comment focusing on the nature of the employment relationship. According to the law n. 45/2018, the driver can be employed or carry out a self-employed activity, while the platform exercises some managerial powers, including the control of working hours. A final reflection is dedicated to the presumption of subordination set out in the same law, based on elements not fully according to the work in the digital age.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Tax Code has become so confusing and complex that tax professionals have gone from being a luxury to a necessity. Compound this complexity with the added layer of intricacy found at the state level and this already complex system becomes a labyrinth.  While society has favored technological advances, the tax system has not. In particular, telecommuters have found themselves in a sort of limbo – working from home while sometimes simultaneously “working” at their employer’s location. This Note focuses on how this hypothetical of the 1980’s is today a reality, and how the courts of select states have approached this new paradigm. Specifically, this Note elaborates on the positions taken by New York and New Jersey, both major commuting states who have issued relating decisions, as well as what these decisions mean for residents of neighboring states like Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Finally, this Note advocates for uniformity between states, praises existing state policies such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey's, among others, and hopes to revive proposed unifying legislation in light of recent cases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the extent to which impacts of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program on children's academic outcomes vary by key characteristics associated with families’ propensity to earn the rewards offered by the program. We utilize an experimental study of Opportunity NYC-Family Rewards, a comprehensive CCT program in New York City in which low-income families were offered rewards for outcomes in health, education, and work. Building from a technique in propensity score research but used here to assess subgroup impacts in experimental studies, we use multiple baseline characteristics to predict the amount of rewards earned as a means to identify theoretically important, multivariate-defined groups of children for whom program effects might be more concentrated. Fourth-grade children in families with higher likelihood to earn rewards experienced more positive impacts of the program on academic outcomes. By contrast, no program impacts were found among 7th- or 9th-graders whose famil...",

        "abstract": "Copyright protection within the theatre industry is quite prevalent, with playwrights, composers, and various other technical roles enjoying clear-cut copyright protection. However, whether or not copyright protection extends specifically to stage directions, arguably a massive theatrical element to a stage production, is a question that the courts have, thus far, failed to answer. This issue has come up in a handful of cases beginning in the mid-1990s with directors bringing suit after other theatrical companies had used their staging without permission. However, every single one of these cases has been resolved or dismissed without the courts ever reaching the question of whether stage directions are a proper subject of applicable copyright law. As such, this question has mostly been debated in legal journals.This Note examines this unanswered question. Part I explores the history and background of the Copyright Act and its current application to the theatrical stage, as well as examines past disputes over theatrical collaboration. Part II discusses several arguments for why stage directions are protected under the Copyright Act, and also provides reasons why staging should be protectable intellectual property. Part III explores the counter arguments for copyright protection for stage directions. Part IV offers a solution to the dispute by applying standards used in determining copyright protection for fictional characters to stage directions. In applying these standards, this Note argues that stage directions can be afforded copyright protection in limited instances.",

        "abstract": "This article offers insights into the Court-packing controversy of 1937 by analyzing the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions between the election of 1936 and President Roosevelt's announcement of his Court-packing proposal in February 1937. These forgotten decisions, which scholars have either ignored or neglected to consider in their political context, sustained the constitutionality of a wide range of economic regulatory legislation and helped to expand personal liberties. Although this article contends that these decisions were too little and too late to discourage Roosevelt from proceeding with his Court-packing plan, the article argues that these decisions went far toward restoring public confidence in the Court and helped to turn public opinion against the Court-packing bill even before the Court's so-called switch in time during the spring of 1937. The article, which devotes special attention to the voting patterns of Chief Justice Hughes and Justice Roberts in these decisions, also argues that the election had little direct impact on these decisions, but that general changes in attitudes toward economic regulation may have influenced the Court.",

An \"experimental\" group was offered vouchers valid only in a low-poverty neighborhood; a \"Section 8\" group was offered traditional housing vouchers without geographic restriction; a control group was not offered vouchers. Our sample consists largely of black and Hispanic female household heads with children. Five years after random assignment, the families offered housing vouchers through MTO lived in safer neighborhoods that had significantly lower poverty rates than those of the control group not offered vouchers. However, we find no significant overall effects on adult employment, earnings, or public assistance receipt -- though our sample sizes are not sufficiently large to rule out moderate effects in either direction. In contrast, we do find significant mental health benefits of the MTO intervention for the experimental group. We also demonstrate a more general pattern for the mental health results using both treatment groups of systematically larger effect sizes for groups experiencing larger changes in neighborhood poverty rates. In our analysis of physical health outcomes, we find a significant reduction in obesity, but no significant effects on four other aspects of physical health (general health, asthma, physical limitations, and hypertension), and our summary measure of physical health was not significantly affected by the MTO treatment for the overall sample.",

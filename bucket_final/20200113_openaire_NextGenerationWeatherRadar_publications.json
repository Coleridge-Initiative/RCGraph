        "abstract": "Automated and accurate radar dealiasing algorithms are very important for their assimilation into operational numerical weather forecasting models. A radar radial velocity dealiasing algorithm aimed at radar data assimilation is introduced and assessed using from several S-band and C-band radar observations under the severe weather conditions of hurricanes, typhoons, and deep continental convection in this paper. This dealiasing algorithm, named automated dealiasing for data assimilation (ADDA), is a further development of the dealiasing algorithm named the China radar network (CINRAD) improved dealiasing algorithm (CIDA), originally developed for China’s CINRAD (China Next Generation Weather Radar) radar network. The improved scheme contains five modules employed to remove noisy data, select the suitable first radial, preserve the convective regions, execute multipass dealiasing in both azimuthal and radial directions and conduct the final local dealiasing with an error check. This new dealiasing algorithm was applied to two hurricane cases, two typhoon cases, and three intense-convection cases that were observed from the CINRAD of China, Taiwan‘s radar network, and NEXRAD (Next Generation Weather Radar) of the U.S. with a continuous period of more than 12 h for each case. The dealiasing results demonstrated that ADDA performed better than CIDA for all selected cases. This algorithm not only produced a high success rate for the S-band radar, but also a reasonable performance for the C-band radar.",

The goal of the simulation study was to establish a complete data quality prediction method based on specific radar hardware and electronics designs. The distributed weather targets were modeled using a covariance matrix-based method. The data quality analysis was conducted using Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) Level-II data as a basis, in which the impact of various pulse compression waveforms and channel electronic instability on weather radar data quality was evaluated. Two typical weather scenarios were employed to assess the simulator’s performance, including a tornado case and a convective precipitation case. Also, modeling of some demonstration systems was evaluated, including a generic weather radar, a planar polarimetric phased-array radar, and a cylindrical polarimetric phased-array radar. Corresponding error statistics were provided to help multifunction phased-array radar (MPAR) designers perform trade-off studies.",

The application and interpretation of these products in the context of aerial bird, bat, and insect movements is an actively developing research front, with potential implications for ecological and conservation studies. The following conceptually derives the definition of these products specifically for NEXRAD weather surveillance radars in the case of biological scatterers. Several cases are presented that illustrate characteristic values and variability of polarimetric quantities for birds and insects, and highlight site-specific differences within the NEXRAD network. Finally, a short prospectus of future directions and applications within the field of polarimetric radar aeroecology is outlined.",

        "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program's Southern Great Plains (SGP) site includes a heterogeneous distributed scanning Doppler radar network suitable for collecting coordinated Doppler velocity measurements in deep convective clouds. The surrounding National Weather Service (NWS) Next Generation Weather Surveillance Radar 1988 Doppler (NEXRAD WSR-88D) further supplements this network. Radar velocity measurements are assimilated in a three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) algorithm that retrieves horizontal and vertical air motions over a large analysis domain (100 km x 100 km) at storm-scale resolutions (250 m). For the first time, direct evaluation of retrieved vertical velocities with those from collocated 915-MHz radar wind profilers is performed. Mean absolute and root-mean-square differences between the two methods are on the order of 1 m s −1 and 2 m s −1 , respectively. Moderate time-height correlations on the order of 0.5 are also shown to exist between the two methods. An empirical sensitivity analysis is done to determine a range of 3DVAR constraint weights that adequately satisfy both velocity observations and anelastic mass continuity. It is shown that the vertical velocity spread over this range is on the order of 1 m s −1 . A similar sensitivity analysis reveals that iterative multi-Doppler techniques have difficulty satisfying velocity observations and mass continuity simultaneously. These results provide a form of assurance in the use of 3DVAR retrieved vertical velocities for evaluating numerical simulations of deep convective clouds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Rainfall observed on the ground is dependent on the four dimensional structure of precipitation aloft. Scanning radars can observe the four dimensional structure of precipitation. Neural network is a nonparametric method to represent the nonlinear relationship between radar measurements and rainfall rate. The relationship is derived directly from a dataset consisting of radar measurements and rain gauge measurements. The performance of neural network based rainfall estimation is subject to many factors, such as the representativeness and sufficiency of the training dataset, the generalization capability of the network to new data, seasonal changes, and regional changes. Improving the performance of the neural network for real time applications is of great interest. The goal of this paper is to investigate the performance of rainfall estimation based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks using radar reflectivity as input and rain gauge as the target. Data from Melbourne, Florida NEXRAD (Next Generation Weather Radar) ground radar (KMLB) over different years along with rain gauge measurements are used to conduct various investigations related to this problem. A direct gauge comparison study is done to demonstrate the improvement brought in by the neural networks and to show the feasibility of this system. The principal components analysis (PCA) technique is also used to reduce the dimensionality of the training dataset. Reducing the dimensionality of the input training data will reduce the training time as well as reduce the network complexity which will also avoid over fitting.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. X-band Synthetic Aperture Radars (X-SARs), able to image the Earth's surface at metric resolution, may provide a unique opportunity to measure rainfall over land with spatial resolution of about few hundred meters, due to the atmospheric moving-target degradation effects. This capability has become very appealing due to the recent launch of several X-SAR satellites, even though several remote sensing issues are still open. This work is devoted to: (i) explore the potential of X-band high-resolution detection and retrieval of rainfall fields from space using X-SAR signal backscattering amplitude and interferometric phase; (ii) evaluate the effects of spatial resolution degradation by precipitation and inhomogeneous beam filling when comparing to other satellite-based sensors. Our X-SAR analysis of precipitation effects has been carried out using both a TerraSAR-X (TSX) case study of Hurricane \"Gustav\" in 2008 over Mississippi (USA) and a COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) X-SAR case study of orographic rainfall over Central Italy in 2009. For the TSX case study the near-surface rain rate has been retrieved from the normalized radar cross section by means of a modified regression empirical algorithm (MREA). A relatively simple method to account for the geometric effect of X-SAR observation on estimated rainfall rate and first-order volumetric effects has been developed and applied. The TSX-retrieved rain fields have been compared to those estimated from the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) in Mobile (AL, USA). The rainfall detection capability of X-SAR has been tested on the CSK case study using the repeat-pass coherence response and qualitatively comparing its signature with ground-based Mt. Midia C-band radar in central Italy. A numerical simulator to represent the effect of the spatial resolution and the antenna pattern of TRMM satellite Precipitation Radar (PR) and Microwave Imager (TMI), using high-resolution TSX-retrieved rain images, has been also set up in order to evaluate the rainfall beam filling phenomenon. As expected, the spatial average can modify the statistics of the high-resolution precipitation fields, strongly reducing its dynamics in a way non-linearly dependent on the rain rate local average value.",

        "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Core Observatory is equipped with a dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) with capability of measuring precipitation simultaneously at frequencies of 13.6 GHz (Ku-band) and 35.5 GHz (Ka-band). Since the GPM-DPR cannot use information from polarization diversity, radar reflectivity factor is the most important parameter used in all retrievals. In this study, GPM’s observations of reflectivity at dual-frequency and instantaneous rainfall products are compared quantitatively against dual-polarization ground-based NEXRAD radars from the GPM Validation Network (VN). The ground radars, chosen for this study, are located in the southeastern plains of the U.S.A. with altitudes varying from 5 to 210 m. It is a challenging task to quantitatively compare measurements from space-based and ground-based platforms due to their difference in resolution volumes and viewing geometry. To perform comparisons on a point-to-point basis, radar observations need to be volume matched by averaging data in common volume or by re-sampling data to a common grid system. In this study, a 3-D volume matching technique first proposed by Bolen and Chandrasekar (2003) and later modified by Schwaller and Morris (2011) is applied to both radar data. DPR and ground radar observations and products are cross validated against each other with a large data set. Over 250 GPM overpass cases at 5 NEXRAD locations, starting from April 2014 to June 2018, have been considered. Analysis shows that DPR Kuand Ka-Band reflectivities are well matched with ground radar with correlation coefficient as high as 0.9 for Ku-band and 0.85 for Ka-band. Ground radar calibration is also checked by observing variation in mean biases of reflectivity between DPR and GR over time. DPR rainfall products are also evaluated. Though DPR underestimates higher rainfall rates in convective cases, its overall performance is found to be satisfactory.",

        "abstract": "Since the advent of dual-polarization radar technology, many studies have been conducted to determine the extent to which the differential reflectivity (ZDR) and specific differential phase shift (KDP) add benefits to estimating rain rates ( R ) compared to reflectivity ( Z ) alone. It has been previously noted that this new technology provides significant improvement to rain-rate estimation, primarily for ranges within 125 km of the radar. Beyond this range, it is unclear as to whether the National Weather Service (NWS) conventional R ( Z )-convective algorithm is superior, as little research has investigated radar precipitation estimate performance at larger ranges. The current study investigates the performance of three radars – St. Louis (KLSX), Kansas City (KEAX), and Springfield (KSGF), MO – with 15 tipping bucket gauges serving as ground truth to the radars. With over 300 h of precipitation data being analyzed for the current study, it was found that, in general, performance degraded with range beyond, approximately, 150 km from each of the radars. Probability of detection (PoD) in addition to bias values decreased, while the false alarm rates increased as range increased. Bright-band contamination was observed to play a potential role as large increases in the absolute bias and overall error values near 120 km for the cool season and 150 km in the warm season. Furthermore, upwards of 60 % of the total error was due to precipitation being falsely estimated, while 20 % of the total error was due to missed precipitation. Correlation coefficient values increased by as much as 0.4 when these instances were removed from the analyses (i.e., hits only). Overall, due to the lowest normalized standard error (NSE) of less than 1.0, a National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) R ( Z ,ZDR) equation was determined to be the most robust, while a R (ZDR,KDP) algorithm recorded NSE values as high as 5. The addition of dual-polarized technology was shown to estimate quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) better than the conventional equation. The analyses further our understanding of the strengths and limitations of the Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) system overall and from a seasonal perspective.",

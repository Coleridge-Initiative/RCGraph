        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo estimate Prenatal Care Coordination's (PNCC) effect on birth outcomes for Wisconsin Medicaid-covered deliveries.\n\n\nDATA SOURCE\nA longitudinal cohort of linked Wisconsin birth records (2008-2012), Medicaid claims, and state-administered social services.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nWe defined PNCC treatment dichotomously (none vs. any) and by service level (none vs. assessment/care plan only vs. service uptake). Outcomes were birthweight (grams), low birthweight (<2500 g), gestational age (completed weeks), and preterm birth (<37 weeks). We estimated PNCC's effect on birth outcomes, adjusting for maternal characteristics, using inverse-probability of treatment weighted and sibling fixed effects regressions.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS\nWe identified 136 224 Medicaid-paid deliveries, of which 33 073 (24.3 percent) linked to any PNCC claim and 22 563 (16.6 percent) linked to claims for PNCC service uptake.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nSibling fixed effects models-which best adjust for unobserved confounding and treatment selection-produced the largest estimates for all outcomes. For example, in these models, PNCC service uptake was associated with a 1.3 percentage point (14 percent) reduction and a 1.8 percentage point (17 percent) reduction in the probabilities of low birthweight and preterm birth, respectively (all P < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPNCC's modest but significant improvement of birth outcomes should motivate stronger PNCC outreach and implementation of similar programs elsewhere.",

        "abstract": "Drawing on a unique data set that links information on all Wisconsin households receiving means-tested benefits with the educational performance of all Wisconsin public school students in these households, we estimate the effect of a family's initial receipt of housing assistance on students’ subsequent achievement outcomes. We estimate these effects using two different comparison groups. Our first comparison group consists of children living in households that receive housing assistance starting four years after our treatment group—we use observations from those students’ pre-receipt years as the basis for the comparison. Our second comparison group consists of low-income students whose families never received housing assistance, but did receive other forms of means-tested benefits, such as SNAP, TANF, or Medicaid. Overall, our results suggest a positive relationship between housing assistance and math achievement, but the magnitude of this relationship is modest and not consistently statistically significant. We provide evidence that this relationship varies by student race and by type of housing assistance—a voucher or public housing. Throughout, we find little evidence of any relationship between housing assistance and student reading scores.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal care coordination programs direct pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries to medical, social, and educational services to improve birth outcomes. Despite the relevance of service context and treatment level to investigations of program implementation and estimates of program effect, prior investigations have not consistently attended to these factors. This study examines the reach and uptake of Wisconsin’s Prenatal Care Coordination (PNCC) program among Medicaid-covered, residence occurrence live births between 2008 and 2012. Data come from the Big Data for Little Kids project, which harmonizes birth records with multiple state administrative sources. Logistic regression analyses measured the association between county- and maternal-level factors and the odds of any PNCC use and the odds of PNCC uptake (> 2 PNCC services among those assessed). Among identified Medicaid-covered births (n = 136,057), approximately 24% (n = 33,249) received any PNCC and 17% (n = 22,680) took up PNCC services. Any PNCC receipt and PNCC uptake varied substantially across counties. A higher county assessment rate was associated with a higher odds of individual PNCC assessment but negatively associated with uptake. Mothers reporting clinical risk factors such as chronic hypertension and previous preterm birth were more likely to be assessed for PNCC and, once assessed, more likely to received continued PNCC services. However, most mothers reporting clinical risk factors were not assessed for services. Estimates of care coordination’s effects on birth outcomes should account for service context and the treatment level into which participants select.",

        "abstract": "Early childbearing is associated with a host of educational and economic disruptions for teenage girls and increased risk of adverse outcomes for their children. Low-income, maltreated, and foster youth have a higher risk of teen motherhood than the general population of youth. In this study, we assessed differences in the risk of early motherhood among these groups and investigated whether differences likely reflect selection factors versus effects of involvement with Child Protective Services (CPS) or foster care. Using a statewide linked administrative data system for Wisconsin, we employed survival analysis to estimate the hazard of early birth (child conceived prior to age 18) among females. We found that both the youth involved in CPS and youth in foster care were at significantly higher risk of early motherhood than low-income youth, and these differences were not explained by a range of sociodemographic and family composition characteristics. Moreover, our findings indicate that CPS and foster care are unlikely to be causal agents in the risk of early motherhood: among foster youth, risk was lower during foster care compared with before; among CPS-involved girls, risk was the same or lower after CPS investigation compared with before. Subsequent analysis showed that after girls exited foster care, those who were reunified with their birth families were at higher risk than those placed in adoption or guardianship. Overall, our findings suggest that whereas CPS and foster youth are high-risk populations for early motherhood, CPS involvement and foster care placement do not exacerbate, and may instead reduce, risk.",

Public policy prioritizes permanency (exiting foster care through reunification with birth parents, adoption, or legal guardianship) to promote foster youths’ healthy development and well-being, but little empirical evidence indicates that permanency, including its most preferred form—reunification—promotes positive outcomes. Using multi-system, statewide longitudinal administrative data, we employed logistic and mixed-effects regression to examine educational attainment and earnings among former foster youth in early adulthood. We found that youth who aged out of care had significantly higher odds of graduating high school and enrolling in college than did reunified youth and youth who exited to guardianship, and they had similar odds as adopted youth. Earnings were similar across groups. Among aged-out (but not reunified) youth, odds of high school graduation and average earnings were higher for youth who spent ...",

        "abstract": "Most families in the child protective services system also interact with the child support enforcement system. This study exploits a natural experiment in Wisconsin, created by the state's large regional variation in child support referral policy, to estimate a potentially important effect of child support enforcement on the duration of out-of-home foster care placement. The effect we examine is whether requiring parents to pay support to offset the costs of foster care delays children's reunification with a parent or other permanent placement. We find evidence of this unintended effect, which is important not only because longer foster care spells are expensive for taxpayers, but also because extended placements in foster care may have consequences for child well-being. Our results highlight the potential importance of cross-systems analysis and the potential consequences when the policies and fundamental objectives of public systems are inconsistently coordinated. We discuss the implications of our findings for child support and child protective services policy.",

Our sample consists of 13 329 custodial mothers with new orders from 2002 to 2006. Across several measures of child support and specifications of moves, regular receipt is negatively associated with any moves and with more than one move a year, holding constant the value of the child support received. In models examining associations between regularity and changes in housing quality after a move, an additional month of child support within 25 per cent of the order amount is associated with an $890 increase in housing value. These results imply that policy-makers concerned with housing stability consider both the regularity and absolute value of child support when considering family well-being.",

Our empirical analyses used piecewise exponential survival models to estimate the risk of CPS involvement (investigation or substantiation) as a function of a home foreclosure filing and a set of individual and household characteristics. We fitted these models with and without the inclusion of propensity score weights.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHouseholds that experienced a foreclosure filing had a much higher probability of CPS involvement. This was true in the year before the filing as well as the year after the foreclosure filing. However, these associations were generally largest in the period before or shortly afterward.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExperiencing a foreclosure filing is associated with increased CPS involvement. However, it is not clear that this association is driven by the foreclosure filing action itself. Rather, increased risk of CPS involvement is apparent during the process of moving toward the filing as well as the year or so after the filing, both of which are likely characterized by limited economic resources as well as by financial and other stress.",

We analyzed the relation between OHP and academic achievement, focusing on reading and math achievement in grades 3 through 8.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLinked administrative data were used for our analytic sample comprising 529 597 child-year observations for 222 049 children who experienced OHP or were in a comparison group. Three models were estimated: a pooled ordinary least squares regression that considered placement status and test scores net of the full set of control variables; an identical model that added the previous year's test scores as an additional control; and a final model that included child-specific fixed effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChildren in OHP settings had achievement test scores at least 0.6 SD below average. However, we found similar deficits across children with past, current, and future exposure to OHP and, in our preferred model, OHP (past, current, or future placement) had no statistically discernible relation with either reading or math achievement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOHP by itself is not significantly related to school achievement; however, evidence reveals consistently low average math and reading achievement among children involved with Child Protective Services.",

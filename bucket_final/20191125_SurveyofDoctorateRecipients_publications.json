        "abstract": "The emergence of open science and new data practices is changing the way research is done. Opportunities to access data through purpose built platforms and repositories, combined with emerging data and meta-data curation practices are expanding data availability in many fields. This paper presents a conceptual framework for studying scientific research careers, motivated by opportunities to link empirical datasets to construct new analyses that address remaining and emerging knowledge gaps. The research career conceptual framework (RCCF) emerges from a review of relevant theories and empirical findings regarding research careers. The paper reviews existing models and develops a typology of research careers. It also compiles a list of variables drawn from the literature on research careers. Two preliminary demonstrations of linking datasets to address empirical questions are outlined. The final discussion advocates an approach to emerging data opportunities that combines theories and models with empirical research questions as being superior to an approach that produces ad hoc explanations on the basis of ‘data fishing’ exercises.",

There are problems with the categories themselves but without too deep an investigation of these, these percentages are representative of the demography of biology as a whole over the latter portion of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century. However, evolutionary biologists would argue (and correctly so) that the representation of persons of African descent in our field is probably an order of magnitude lower (0.3%). This commentary focuses on the factors that are associated with underrepresentation of African Americans in evolutionary science careers.",

        "abstract": "When analyzing knowledge production, the evidence suggests that within the USA, foreign-born researchers exhibit more productivity than their domestic counterparts. Previous literature indicates that productivity differences can be explained by higher academic ability and the selection of more research-oriented fields among foreign-born. In this study, we use individual data from the restricted-access version of the Survey of Doctoral Recipients between 1995 and 2003 to extend this notion and compare knowledge production, in terms of papers presented, articles published, patent applications, and patents granted, of foreign-born and domestic PhD recipients. Our results strongly support the notion that foreign-born researchers, and especially naturalized US citizens, outperform their domestic counterparts in all four of our measures of knowledge production. We show that while aspects associated with academic training, quality of the school, occupation mismatch, and fields of study, among others, play a role in productivity differentials, they only account for a small proportion of the variability. We develop a theoretical a model to show that non-directly observable aspects associated with non-academic ability of foreign-born and a better match between the student and the PhD program, associated with differing opportunity costs of attending the program, may explain the results. Different specifications and robustness checks are conducted to provide support to our theory.",

This transfer is being controlled, more and more, by the use of Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs). Therefore, the effect of MTAs on the dynamic of knowledge creation is an important concern. The aim of this research is to characterise the restrictions imposed by MTAs, and their determinants. We consider MTA diversity based on a comprehensive analysis of the clauses included in 171 MTAs signed by two French universities. We show that the clauses included in MTAs depend on several factors such as kind of material involved, research field, patenting and collection of material. We find that the presence of an industry actor is not associated to more restrictions on publication and intellectual property. We propose a typology of MTAs corresponding to different transfer situations. We discuss the role of MTAs as collaborative tools and the influence of the legal, scientific, political and organisational context.",

We also examined associations between students’ interaction classifications, their demographic backgrounds (e.g., gender, international student status, first-generation status, and underrepresented racial/ethnic minority status), and doctoral outcomes (e.g., sense of belonging, satisfaction with academic development, institutional commitment, and scholarly productivity). The findings revealed that three distinct subgroups existed among the current sample of biology Ph.D. students, with respect to their interactions with their faculty and peers: high interaction with faculty and peers, high interaction with peers only, and low interaction with faculty and peers. However, such patterns of doctoral students’ interactions with faculty and peers tended to, in general, be stable over time. In addition, while the differential effects of demographic variables on changes in these interaction patterns were widely founded, such changes were not substantially linked to doctoral student outcomes. Implications for research on doctoral education and socialization theory are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The biomedical sciences have a problem retaining white women and underrepresented minorities in academia. Despite increases in the representation of these groups in faculty candidate pools, they are still underrepresented at the faculty level, particularly at the Full Professor level. The lack of diverse individuals at the Full Professor level contributes to the attrition of women and under-represented minorities, as it confirms unconscious biases. The presence of unconscious biases contribute to feelings of not belonging by trainees and are amplified by visual representation of who is presented as the \"top scientist in their field\". Top scientists are not only defined by the attainment of Full Professorships, but also through invited seminar series. Invitations for faculty to present their research at other university departments is highly valued offer that provides an opportunity for collaborations and networking. However, if invited speakers do not represent the demographics of current trainees, these visual representations of successful scientists may contribute to decreased attitudes of self-identification as a scientist, ultimately resulting in trainees leaving the field or the academy. In this study, we compare invited-speaker demographics to the current trainee demographics in one microbiology and immunology department and find that trainees are not proportionally represented by speakers invited to the department. Our investigation prompted changes in policy for how invited speakers are selected in the future to invite a more diverse group of scientists. To facilitate this process, we developed a set of tips and a web-based resource that allows scientists, committees, and moderators to identify members of under-served groups. These resources can be easily adapted by other fields or sub-fields to promote inclusion and diversity at seminar series, conferences, and colloquia.",

They find that, in both countries, those with an academic background have lower rates of entry into entrepreneurship than do those with a non-academic background. The relative rate of academics starting entrepreneurial firms is slightly lower in the United States than in Sweden. Moreover, the mean economic gains from becoming an entrepreneur are negative, both for PhDs originating in academia and for non-academic settings in both countries. Analysis indicates that selection into entrepreneurship occurs from the lower part of the ability distribution among academics.

But while numerous biotech spin-offs have been created in the U.S., few have been established in Europe, despite research in biotech and the presence of star scientists. In addition to the prestige of a researcher, we would therefore like to examine the importance of university culture and peer effects for the intention to create a spin-off. Because of the inadequacy of existing prestige indices, we created a new index to measure the prestige of scientists for our analysis. With data from 533 German and Swiss scientists in the life sciences, we will show that, besides other variables, prestige and peer effects influence the intention to create a university spin-off.",

However, there is a lack of understanding regarding why researchers may participate in various forms of collaborative research, especially among graduate students in environmental conservation. We explored graduate students’ research experiences and the characteristics and attitudes associated with collaborative research and two specific types of collaboration: interdisciplinary collaboration and engaged research. We surveyed 56 graduate students who were affiliated with University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program on biodiversity conservation under novel ecosystems. We investigated differences between the different categories of collaborative research with logistic regression and decision tree analysis using the classification and regression tree (CRT) algorithm. Students with more collaborators were more likely to feel supported by an intellectual community and view interdisciplinary research as vital for conservation practice. Students with an interdisciplinary collaboration were more likely to be comfortable collaborating with peers but less likely to view collaboration as contributing to their research. Students engaged with non-academics were less comfortable collaborating with faculty and more concerned that becoming engaged with conservation policy or practice may negatively impact them. Of the ten instances in which variables were significant across the three logistic regressions, eight were also identified in the CRT model. This suggests relatively high agreement between the two statistical approaches. The different forms of collaborative research had different predictors and should not be viewed as interchangeable. Further attention is needed on approaches for enhancing graduate students’ training and experience with collaborative environmental research.",

Efforts to diversify the professoriate have necessitated a better understanding of career outcomes for current female faculty and faculty of color. We measure risk of leaving without tenure and years to promotion from associate to full professor at four large land grant universities. We model career outcomes as competing risks, and compute cumulative incidence functions to discern differences in tenure and promotion outcomes by gender and race. We find incidence rates vary significantly by academic discipline, and in many instances, show larger effects than gender and racial or ethnic differences. Our examination also indicates that in particular academic fields, females are more prone to leave without tenure, and less likely to be promoted to full professor. We also find that racial or ethnic minorities are less likely to be promoted to full professor in certain areas. The analysis suggests that for universities to address systemic issues of underrepresentation in academe, they must account for department level contexts, and align institutional practices to support the goal of inclusion and diversity.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses gender differences in international research collaboration measured through international co-authorship. The study is based on a dataset consisting of 5600 Norwegian researchers and their publication output during a 3-year period (44,000 publications). Two different indicators are calculated. First, the share of researchers that have been involved in international collaboration as measured by co-authorship, and second, the share of their publications with international co-authorship. The study shows that the field of research is by far the most important factor influencing the propensity to collaborate internationally. There are large differences from humanities on the one hand, where international collaboration in terms of co-authorship is less common, to the natural sciences on the other, where such collaboration is very frequent. On an overall level, we find distinct gender differences in international research collaboration in Norway in the favour of men. However, men and women are not equally distributed across fields and there are relatively more female researchers in fields where the international collaboration rates generally are lower. When the data are analysed by scientific field, academic position, and publication productivity of the researchers, the gender differences in the propensity to collaborate with colleagues in other countries are minor only, and not statistically significant. Concerning gender inequality in science, the main challenge seems to be the lower productivity level of female researchers, which obviously hinders their academic career development. Differences in international collaboration are unlikely to be an important factor in this respect, at least not in the Norwegian research context analysed in this study.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the contribution of external-to-the-firm knowledge to the inventive process inside companies by exploiting a survey of industrial inventors combined with patent data. In the empirical analysis, inventors’ knowledge sourcing strategies are employed as explanatory factors for their inventive performance. The results suggest that both the separate and joint use of external scientific and market knowledge are positively and significantly associated with inventors’ quantity and quality of inventions. In addition, higher levels of education act as a moderating factor of the joint use of scientific and market knowledge. Tracing a positive link between external knowledge and individual inventive process is relevant for research as well as policy, considering that knowledge exchange across a wide range of organisations is at the core of the innovation policy agendas in most countries.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the disadoption of rbST and addresses two key questions related to rbST use and its effects on dairy profitability. First, what are the determinants of the disadoption decision, and do they differ from those of the adoption decision? Second, do the earnings of disadopters differ from those of current adopters? Using a nationally representative dataset of U.S. dairies from 2010, a bivariate probit model with partial observability and an endogenous switching model is estimated. Consistent with other studies, the results show that rbST use does not have a statistically significant effect on dairy profitability. However, within the group of producers who have adopted rbST, I present some empirical evidence that disadopters are doing worse off than those who are still using rbST.",

We developed an IMPLAN-based SAM model of the South Carolina economy that takes into account the opportunity cost of money spent at farmers’ markets to estimate the net as opposed to gross impact of the campaign on the state economy. Our results indicate that the Certified South Carolina Grown Campaign (an example of a widely used “buy local foods” policies) does not make a major contribution to the state economy. Our findings suggest that policy makers need to augment buy local campaigns with other efforts, such as a value-added processing of regionally produced foods, if such policies are to serve as a means of generating economic growth.",

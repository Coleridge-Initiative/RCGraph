        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the disadoption of rbST and addresses two key questions related to rbST use and its effects on dairy profitability. First, what are the determinants of the disadoption decision, and do they differ from those of the adoption decision? Second, do the earnings of disadopters differ from those of current adopters? Using a nationally representative dataset of U.S. dairies from 2010, a bivariate probit model with partial observability and an endogenous switching model is estimated. Consistent with other studies, the results show that rbST use does not have a statistically significant effect on dairy profitability. However, within the group of producers who have adopted rbST, I present some empirical evidence that disadopters are doing worse off than those who are still using rbST.",

Findings show that the distribution of wealth in 1996 was slightly more concentrated than in 1999, with the farm wealth component contributing significantly more toward measured concentration in both years than the nonfarm wealth component. The robustness of the findings under varied value judgments concerning society's level of aversion to wealth concentration is also examined.",

We developed an IMPLAN-based SAM model of the South Carolina economy that takes into account the opportunity cost of money spent at farmers’ markets to estimate the net as opposed to gross impact of the campaign on the state economy. Our results indicate that the Certified South Carolina Grown Campaign (an example of a widely used “buy local foods” policies) does not make a major contribution to the state economy. Our findings suggest that policy makers need to augment buy local campaigns with other efforts, such as a value-added processing of regionally produced foods, if such policies are to serve as a means of generating economic growth.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how decoupled direct payments, paid to farm operators based on historical yields and base acreage, may lead to production distortions by altering a farmer's access to credit or enabling the farmer to receive more favorable credit terms. The authors estimate the impact of decoupled direct payments under the 2002 Farm Bill on the credit terms of farm operators, specifically the interest rate on short-term operating loans. If farm operators are able to obtain more favorable credit terms and reduce their operating cost, then this offers an additional mechanism through which decoupled payments may distort current production. Design/methodology/approach - The authors estimate the impact of decoupled direct payments on the interest rate on short-term operating loans. In the analysis, the authors control for farm financial characteristics, farm operator characteristics, and other factors. Data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey for the years 2005-2007, are used in the weighted regression analysis. Jackknifed standard errors are also computed. Findings - As the proportion of base acres to total operated acres increases it is found that interest rates decline by a small but statistically significant amount. This implies that direct payments lead to lower operating costs through better credit terms. Research limitations/implications - Lower operating costs may in turn allow some farmers to expand production or produce on land that would otherwise be unprofitable to operate and hence left idle. Ultimately, this distorts current production. However, the small magnitude of the authors' results suggests that the reduction in interest rates, though positive, may have limited distortionary impacts. Originality/value - The paper provides evidence that decoupled payments alter a farm operator's credit terms and hence could lead to current production distortions. The paper contributes to the growing body of research investigating the mechanisms by which decoupled payments have the potential to distort current production.",

        "abstract": "This research uses data from the 2005–2011 Agricultural Resource Management Survey and a two-part-model regression procedure to examine the impact of health insurance and other relevant socio-economic factors on the distribution of health care expenditures among U.S. farm households. Find-ings show the importance of privately acquired health insurance coverage in explaining inequality in health care expenditures. The results also reveal, among other things, a statistical positive association between health care expenditures and farm operators who fall into the baby boomer age category. A similar statistical association is found for higher income levels but not for inequality of income.",

        "abstract": "Integrated crop–livestock systems have included grazing perennial grasses during the spring and summer and corn (Zea mays L.) residues during the winter. Our objectives were to identify opportunities for expanded corn residue use through grazing and provide an economic assessment for value-added grazing. We estimated the economic value to the crop sector through grazing leased corn residue at over $95 million for Nebraska, South Dakota, Kansas, and North Dakota under current management. Additionally, gross economic value to the livestock sector in these states was estimated at greater than $191 million. Advantages for increased grazing use of corn residue include managing residue quantity in high-yielding environments, providing a source of supplemental revenue, and expanding integrated crop–livestock systems using a simple, but cost-efficient practice.

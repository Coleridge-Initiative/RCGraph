        "abstract": "Groundwater nitrate contamination has been an issue in the Platte River Valley of Nebraska since the 1960s, with groundwater nitrate-N concentrations frequently in excess of 10 mg L. This article summarizes education and regulatory efforts to reduce the environmental impact of irrigated crop production in the Platte River Valley. In 1988, a Groundwater Management Area (GWMA) was implemented in the Central Platte Natural Resources District to encourage adoption of improved management practices. Since 1988, there have been steady declines in average groundwater nitrate-N concentrations of about 0.15 mg NO-N L yr in much of the GWMA (from 19 to 15 mg NO-N L). However, N use efficiency (NUE) (partial factor productivity for N [PFP]) has increased very little from 1988 to 2012 (60-65 kg grain kg N), whereas statewide PFP increased from 49 to 67 kg grain kg N in the same period. Although growers are encouraged to credit N from sources besides fertilizer (e.g., soil residual, legumes, irrigation water, and manure), confidence in and use of credits tended to decrease as credits became larger; there was a tendency toward an average N rate regardless of credit-based recommendations. This information, coupled with data from other studies, suggests that much of the decline in groundwater nitrate can be attributed to improved irrigation management-especially conversion from furrow to sprinkler irrigation-and to a lesser extent to improved timing of N application. The development and adoption of improved N management practices, such as fertigation, controlled-release N formulation, and use of crop canopy sensors for in-season N application may be required for further significant NUE gains in these irrigated systems.",

        "abstract": "&NA; Corn farmers reported unexpectedly severe damage on fields planted with genetically‐engineered rootworm‐resistant (Bt‐CRW) corn seeds during the 2009 growing season. Entomologists later determined that rootworms on these fields had developed resistance to the insecticidal proteins produced by Bt‐CRW corn. This article explores what corn farmers' seed and soil insecticide choices imply about rootworm resistance in the United States. First, a soil insecticide demand function is derived using a damage‐abatement model. Next, this demand function is estimated using field‐level data from 2005 and 2010. We find that rootworms (Diabrotica spp.) cost farmers approximately $1.3 billion in 2005 and $2 billion in 2010. When used, Bt‐CRW seeds were very effective, reducing average yield losses by approximately five bushels per acre and providing over twice as much control (on average) as soil insecticides. We found no evidence that soil insecticide use was higher on fields where resistance was most likely to develop. However, we did find that demand for soil insecticides was elastic. These results suggest that rootworm resistance was not widespread in 2010, but that it could substantively increase soil insecticide use if it evolved and spread.",

        "abstract": "For self-employed individuals and their families, purchases of health care services and health insurance policies have the potential to impact their health status, as well as the financial viability of their businesses. Most people in the United States receive health insurance coverage through employer-sponsored programs. Self-employed individuals and their households, such as farm households, may face a greater challenge in getting affordable health insurance. Using a large cross-sectional farm household level dataset, we estimate the impact of the source of health insurance on health care expenditures of farm households in the United States. Results suggest that farm households purchasing individual health insurance directly from vendors are likely to spend more on health care than those with other sources of health insurance. After controlling for a variety of personal and local area characteristics, having health insurance was negatively related to total health care expenditures. Age and income, not surprisingly, were also found to be significant in explaining health care expenditures.",

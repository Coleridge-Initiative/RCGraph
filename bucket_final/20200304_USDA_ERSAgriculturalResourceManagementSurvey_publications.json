        "abstract": "Recent advances in cooperative theory have focused on membership heterogeneity as being a significant challenge for cooperative sustainability. We use predictive analytics to forecast U.S. farmer cooperative sustainability at an aggregate level and include multiple dimensions of membership heterogeneity. We report the importance and shape of the effect of membership heterogeneity when predicting and forecasting cooperative sustainability in the near-term. We also report forecasts of cooperative sustainability given expected changes to membership heterogeneity. The data this study used are from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Economic Research Service (ERS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) joined with USDA-Rural Development cooperative financial data at the state level. Membership heterogeneity was found to be less relevant than other variables included in the model for predicting cooperative business volume and number of cooperatives headquartered per state, and an estimate of cooperative sustainability. Membership heterogeneity effects were mostly offsetting given expected changes to member heterogeneity, and/or were offset due to changes to other macro factors. Consequently, we conclude membership heterogeneity may affect the number of cooperatives and extent consistent with theoretical literature at a micro level; however, we also expect a similar level of sustainability of cooperatives at an aggregate level in the near-term despite changes to membership heterogeneity.",

        "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O, a potent greenhouse gas; GHG) is emitted at relatively high rates from corn-based agricultural systems. N2O mitigation strategies, in addition to reducing GHG emissions, ideally would not increase other harmful pollutants (such as leached nitrate, NO3, or volatilized ammonia, NH3) or decrease crop yield. We used the Denitrification-Decomposition model (DNDC) to simulate an array of single and combined interventions to corn management across broad range of physical conditions (climate and soil) in the Midwest US. We assumed a typical crop management baseline of continuous corn or corn-soy with conventional tillage and urea-ammonium nitrate fertilizer broadcast to the soil surface. Interventions included fertilizer nitrogen (N) form, controlled-release N, addition of nitrification inhibitors, N rate, split sidedress N applications, sub-soil N placement, and reduced tillage. Single-factor interventions which reduced N2O in all locales included a change to urea fertilizer, nitrification inhibitors, reductions to N rate, and use of N injection: urea fertilizer and nitrification inhibitors both reduced N2O emissions on average (30 and 9%, respectively) while simultaneously reducing NO3 leaching and mostly neutral effects to yield; N rate reductions reduced N2O (11%) but had modest negative effects to yield. Other single-factor interventions increase N2O emissions or N leaching on average but could have beneficial effects under some conditions. Combined interventions frequently include (>50% of the time) urea, nitrification inhibitors, and reduced N. Interventions that, even when combined with other interventions, do not reduce N2O emissions and N leaching include anhydrous ammonia fertilizer, controlled release, and injection. Controlled-release fertilizer results were contrary to those reported in most field studies indicating that DNDC's simulation of linear N release over time may be too simplistic to replicate field conditions.",

This study found considerable variation in the operating and ownership costs for corn, ranging from an average of $1.74 per bushel for low-cost producers to $3.88 per bushel for high-cost producers. In 2010, high corn prices meant that most producers covered their corn production costs from harvest-month prices. The Heartland continues to be the major corn production region with the lowest operating and ownership costs per bushel, mainly because of the region’s high corn yields. The operating and ownership costs per bushel did not vary significantly by enterprise size where size is measured by the number of planted corn acres per farm. However, these costs per planted acre were lowest for farms with the smallest corn enterprises and highest for farms with the largest corn enterprises. Production value less operating and ownership costs per acre from organic corn production was higher than that from conventional corn production because higher prices more than offset lower yields for organic corn.",

        "abstract": "The GreenCert(TM) system was developed to help farm and ranch owners to quantify, standardize, pool and market CO\"2 emissions offset (sequestration) credits derived from improved rangeland or cropland management. It combines a user-friendly interface with the CENTURY biogeochemical model, a GIS database of soil and climate parameters, and a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty estimation methodology. This paper focuses on uncertainty treatment, discussing sources of error, parameter distributions, and the Monte Carlo randomization approach, culminating in a sensitivity analysis of model parameters. Idealized crop and grazing scenarios were used to evaluate the uncertainty of modeled soil organic carbon stocks and stock changes stemming from variability in site and management parameters. Normalized sensitivity coefficients and an integrated index for relative sensitivity of the model to the ensemble of the tested variables indicate that environmental factors are the most important in determining the actual size of the soil carbon stock, but that management is a much more important determinant of short- to medium-term carbon fluxes. GreenCert(TM) uses the patented C-LOCK^(R) approach to efficiently limit uncertainty in the most critical phase of the modelling process by maximizing the use of available management information, and quantifies the remaining uncertainty in an unbiased fashion using Monte Carlo parameter randomization.",

        "abstract": "Farm income is highly variable, and this variability can affect household welfare, agricultural production, and environmental quality. Federal agricultural policies have long sought to shelter farmers from income fluctuations. The 2014 Farm Act focused attention on risk reduction by creating new programs tied to fluctuations in prices, yields, and revenues. ERS researchers use a large panel dataset created from 18 years of the USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to provide new information about the extent of farm household income variability. Analysis compares total income volatility of farm and nonfarm households; for farm households, it compares the volatility of farm and off-farm income and examines how income volatility differs across types of producers and farms of different sizes. A regression analysis explores the determinants of household income volatility and identifies trends in volatility over time. Researchers disaggregate total household income variability into farm, off-farm, and other components to trace how each component contributes to the overall volatility. Lastly, researchers look at the effects of U.S. Government programs on farm household income variability and estimate the risk-reducing benefits of these programs.",

        "abstract": "Beef cow-calf production in the United States is widespread, occurring in every State. Nearly 765,000 farms, about 35 percent of the 2.2 million farms in the United States, had a beef cow inventory in 2007. Most of these were small, part-time operations. About a third of farms that raise beef animals had a beef cow inventory of less than 10 cows, more than half had fewer than 20 cows, and nearly 80 percent had fewer than 50 cows. In this study, ERS uses data from USDA’s 2008 Agricultural Resource Management Survey for U.S. beef cow-calf operations to examine the structure, costs, and characteristics of beef cow-calf producers. Many small operations are “rural residence farms” that specialize in beef cow-calf production, but their income from off-farm sources exceeds that from the farm. Most beef cow-calf production occurs on large farms, but cow-calf production is not the primary enterprise on many of these farms. Findings suggest that operators of beef cow-calf farms have a diverse set of goals for the cattle enterprise.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breastfeeding is known to be the most beneficial way of feeding infants, but 68% of the infants enrolled in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children are fully formula fed. Mandated annual reports about breastfeeding aggregate data from the states into regions, which obscures important information. Research Aim: The aim of this study is to reexamine the data supplied by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children to identify which areas of the United States have the lowest incidence of breastfeeding infants. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted. Data from the Breastfeeding Data Local Agency Report were extracted, graphed, and analyzed. Results: Data provided from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children for fiscal year 2016 show that the range of fully formula fed infants at the regional level is 60% to 78%, while at the state level the range is wider, at 51% to 89%. The states with the largest numbers of fully formula fed infants were Mississippi (89%), Louisiana (88%), Alabama (88%), and Arkansas (87%). When examining data from all 90 reporting agencies, the range of fully formula fed infants was 38% to 95%. Conclusions: Aggregating state, Native American nation, and territorial data at the regional level resulted in a loss of important information. WIC’s current breastfeeding interventions may be more effective in some areas than others. Future research can examine successful and unsuccessful interventions on a state or local level.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the association of the 2009 changes to the US Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food package and childhood obesity trends. We hypothesized that the food package change reduced obesity among children participating in WIC, a population that has been especially vulnerable to the childhood obesity epidemic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used an interrupted time-series design with repeated cross-sectional measurements of state-specific obesity prevalence among WIC-participating 2- to 4-year-old children from 2000 to 2014. We used multilevel linear regression models to estimate the trend in obesity prevalence for states before the WIC package revision and to test whether the trend in obesity prevalence changed after the 2009 WIC package revision, adjusting for changes in demographics. In a secondary analysis, we adjusted for changes in macrosomia and high prepregnancy BMI.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBefore the 2009 WIC food package change, the prevalence of obesity across states among 2- to 4-year-old WIC participants was increasing by 0.23 percentage points annually (95% confidence interval: 0.17 to 0.29; P < .001). After 2009, the trend was reversed (-0.34 percentage points per year; 95% confidence interval: -0.42 to -0.25; P < .001). Changes in sociodemographic and other obesity risk factors did not account for this change in the trend in obesity prevalence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe 2009 WIC food package change may have helped to reverse the rapid increase in obesity prevalence among WIC participants observed before the food package change.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The US Department of Agriculture’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) seeks to improve the health of participating women and children by providing nutrition education and a monthly package of supplemental foods including whole grain bread and cereal. While some studies confirm that participants consume more whole grains, others find no effect. In this study, we hypothesize that the positive association between WIC and whole grains is being reduced in size and consistency by several factors. Design/Setting/Participants: American households were surveyed about their food purchases. Overall response rate was 45.6%. A total of 4826 households completed the survey including 471 WIC households. Measures: The survey recorded households’ purchases of refined and whole grains in bread and cereal over 1 week. Analysis: T tests were used to compare the bread and cereal purchases of WIC and eligible, non-WIC households. Probit models were also estimated to assess a WIC household’s likelihood to choose whole grain foods when using benefits versus other payment methods. Results: On average, WIC households acquired more whole grains in bread than eligible, non-WIC households (1.33 vs 0.72 ounce equivalents per household member aged 1 year or older; P < .05). No difference is found for cereal (P > .10). Moreover, when using payment methods other than WIC benefits, WIC participants are 19% less likely than other households to choose whole grain bread (P < .05) and 20% less likely to choose a whole grain cold cereal (P < .05), which suggests that WIC-provided foods may replace some whole grains participants would otherwise buy for themselves. Conclusion: WIC is positively associated with whole grains. However, the association is stronger for bread than cereal. Moreover, foods provided through the program may partially replace whole grains that WIC households would otherwise buy for themselves.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine the trends in breastfeeding disparities across Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) eligibility and participation statuses in the last 2 decades. Design: Secondary analyses from multiple cross‐sectional surveys. Setting: United States. Participants: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014 included 10,696 children younger than 60 months. Birth cohorts in 4‐year increments were created from 1994 to 2014. Main Outcome Measures: Ever‐breastfed status and breastfed‐at‐6‐months status. Analysis: The prevalence rates of ever‐breastfed and breastfed at 6 months were estimated between WIC‐eligible vs non‐eligible children and WIC‐eligible participants vs eligible nonparticipants. Prevalence rates and their 95% confidence intervals were plotted across birth cohorts. Log‐binomial regression was conducted to test the trends of breastfeeding in each subgroup. Results: Ever‐breastfeeding rates increased from 52% (WIC participants) vs 57% (WIC‐eligible nonparticipants) in the 1994–1997 birth cohort to 71% vs 77% in the 2010–2014 birth cohort—a 36% vs 34% relative increase for participants vs eligible nonparticipants, respectively (P < .001). Breastfeeding‐at‐6‐month rates increased from 28% (participants) vs 30% (eligible nonparticipants) to 34% vs 49% in the same time period—a 21% vs 66% relative increase, respectively (P < .001). Conclusion and Implications: To meet the Healthy People 2020's goal for breastfeeding at 6 months, sustainable postpartum breastfeeding education and interventions may be needed among WIC participants. Future research focusing on identification of the causal relationship between WIC participation and breastfeeding outcomes is warranted.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides monthly food packages to low-income children (aged 1-4 years) in the U.S., including 128 ounces of 100% fruit juice and an $8 cash value voucher for purchasing fruits and vegetables. The fruit juice allowance translates to 71%-107% of the maximum intake recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (4-6 ounces/day). Careful examination of WIC food package allocations is necessary because overconsumption of fruit juice among young children has been linked to weight gain and juice lacks important nutrients found in whole fruit (e.g., fiber).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 1,576 children aged 2-4 years were assessed using the 2009-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Multiple linear regressions were conducted in 2017 to analyze the association between WIC program participation and intake of 100% fruit juice, whole fruits, and vegetables. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between WIC program participation and the odds of exceeding the American Academy of Pediatrics maximum intake for juice.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdjusting for child and parent/caregiver characteristics, WIC participants consumed significantly more 100% fruit juice (β=0.22 cup equivalents/day, 95% CI=0.04, 0.40) compared with income-eligible nonparticipants, but not more whole fruits or total vegetables. WIC participants had 1.51-times greater odds (95% CI=1.06, 2.14) of exceeding the age-specific American Academy of Pediatrics maximum intake for juice compared with income-eligible nonparticipants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings support recommendations to reduce 100% fruit juice allowances in the WIC program and reallocate those funds to the cash value voucher to increase whole fruit and vegetable consumption.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the association of the 2009 changes to the US Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food package and childhood obesity trends. We hypothesized that the food package change reduced obesity among children participating in WIC, a population that has been especially vulnerable to the childhood obesity epidemic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used an interrupted time-series design with repeated cross-sectional measurements of state-specific obesity prevalence among WIC-participating 2- to 4-year-old children from 2000 to 2014. We used multilevel linear regression models to estimate the trend in obesity prevalence for states before the WIC package revision and to test whether the trend in obesity prevalence changed after the 2009 WIC package revision, adjusting for changes in demographics. In a secondary analysis, we adjusted for changes in macrosomia and high prepregnancy BMI.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBefore the 2009 WIC food package change, the prevalence of obesity across states among 2- to 4-year-old WIC participants was increasing by 0.23 percentage points annually (95% confidence interval: 0.17 to 0.29; P < .001). After 2009, the trend was reversed (-0.34 percentage points per year; 95% confidence interval: -0.42 to -0.25; P < .001). Changes in sociodemographic and other obesity risk factors did not account for this change in the trend in obesity prevalence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe 2009 WIC food package change may have helped to reverse the rapid increase in obesity prevalence among WIC participants observed before the food package change.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program is an important intervention for prevention and treatment of obesity and food insecurity, but participation has dropped among eligible populations from 2009 to 2015. Program satisfaction is integral to participant retention, and the retail experience is a vital component of program satisfaction.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis article applies behavioral economics principles to explore the retail experience of WIC participants and ways in which it may be improved.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe authors designed and conducted semistructured interviews and focus groups with WIC participants.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nA convenience sample of WIC participants aged 18 years and older were recruited through WIC clinics in Texas, North Carolina, Oregon, and Illinois (n=55, 27 participants from four focus groups and 28 individual interviews).\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS CONDUCTED\nResponses were analyzed qualitatively using principles of content analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChallenges in identifying WIC-allowable items throughout the store as well as perceived stigmatization during the checkout process were the chief complaints. Study participants described a learning curve in successful use of WIC in retail environments over time. Study participants also reported acceptance of restrictions, such as a requirement to purchase the least expensive brand.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDissatisfaction with the retail experience may lead to the underutilization of WIC benefits or program exit. Behavioral economics strategies that facilitate a better shopping experience, such as creating a section for WIC items in the store or improving in-store education, may improve the retail experience for WIC customers. Further research is needed to ensure such strategies are effective and do not contribute to stigma.",

        "abstract": "Background: Breastfeeding is an important public health initiative. Low-income women benefiting from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) are a prime population for breastfeeding promotion efforts. Research aim: This study aims to determine factors associated with increased likelihood of breastfeeding for WIC participants. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement guided the systematic review of literature. Database searches occurred in September and October 2014 and included studies limited to the previous 10 years. The following search terms were used: low-income; WIC; women, infants, and children; breastfeeding; breast milk; and maternal and child health. The criterion for inclusion was a study sample of women and children enrolled in the WIC program, thereby excluding non-United States–based research. Results: Factors that increased the likelihood of breastfeeding for WIC participants included sociodemographic and health characteristics (n = 17); environmental and media support (n = 4); government policy (n = 2); intention to breastfeed, breastfeeding in hospital, or previous breastfeeding experience (n = 9); attitudes toward and knowledge of breastfeeding benefits (n = 6); health care provider or social support; and time exposure to WIC services (n = 5). Conclusion: The complexity of breastfeeding behaviors within this population is clear. Results provide multisectored insight for future research, policies, and practices in support of increasing breastfeeding rates among WIC participants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Summer Electronic Benefit Transfers for Children (SEBTC) demonstration piloted summer food assistance through electronic benefit transfers (EBTs), providing benefits either through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) EBT.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo inform food assistance policy and describe how demonstrations using WIC and SNAP models differed in benefit take-up and impacts on food security and children's food consumption.\n\n\nDESIGN\nSites chose to deliver SEBTC using the SNAP or WIC EBT system. Within each site, in 2012, households were randomly assigned to a benefit group or a no-benefit control group.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nGrantees (eight states and two Indian Tribal Organizations) selected school districts serving many low-income children. Schoolchildren were eligible in cases where they had been certified for free or reduced-price meals during the school year. Before the demonstration, households in the demonstration sample had lower incomes and lower food security, on average, than households with eligible children nationally.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nGrantees provided selected households with benefits worth $60 per child per summer month using SNAP or WIC EBT systems. SNAP-model benefits covered most foods. WIC-model benefits could only be used for a specific package of foods.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nKey outcomes were children's food security (assessed using the US Department of Agriculture food security scale) and food consumption (assessed using food frequency questions).\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES\nDifferences in mean outcomes between the benefit and control groups measured impact, after adjusting for household characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn WIC sites, benefit-group households redeemed a lower percentage of SEBTC benefits than in SNAP sites. Nonetheless, the benefit groups in both sets of sites had similar large reductions in very low food security among children, relative to no-benefit controls. Children receiving benefits consumed more healthful foods, and these impacts were larger in WIC sites.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults suggest the WIC SEBTC model deserves strong consideration.",

Understanding how these revisions may impact current consumption patterns could be important.\n\n\nMETHODS\nDietary data from the 2011-2014 NHANES were used to estimate the percentage of children who were aged 12 to 23 months consuming selected food and beverage categories on any given day by age and WIC status (children who were on WIC, those who were eligible for but not receiving WIC benefits, and those who were not eligible for WIC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nConsumption of food and beverage categories differed by WIC status. On a given day, a lower percentage of children who were eligible for but did not receive WIC benefits consumed vegetables (excluding white potatoes; 42.3%) and grains (76.5%) compared with children who were participating in WIC (vegetables [excluding white potatoes]: 60.4%; grains: 85.5%) and those who were not eligible for WIC benefits (vegetables [excluding white potatoes]: 58.1%; grains: 87.2%; P < .05). A lower percentage of both children who were eligible for but not receiving WIC benefits and those who were participating in WIC consumed fruits (57.6% and 70.6%, respectively) and snacks (45.9% and 48.5%, respectively) than those who were not eligible for WIC (fruits: 86.4%; snacks: 69.1%; P < .05). A lower percentage of children who were receiving WIC consumed dairy than children who were not eligible for WIC (91.7% and 97.2%, respectively; P < .05). A higher percentage of those who were receiving WIC consumed 100% juice (70.6%) than children who were eligible for but not receiving WIC (51.6%) and children who were not eligible for WIC (50.8%; P < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImproving early WIC participation and retention could positively impact some diet-related disparities among young children who are eligible for WIC.",

        "abstract": "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides foods, education, and referrals to participants who are considered to be at nutritional risk. The outreach of the program is impressive, and nearly 9.17 million people participated in the program in 2010. WIC participation is associated with many positive outcomes, including improved birthweights and childhood dietary practices. Despite these benefits, WIC mothers experience lower breastfeeding rates when compared with demographically similar women who do not participate in the WIC program. According to WIC, \"A breastfeeding mother and her infant shall be placed in the highest priority level.\" Despite this statement and others that support breastfeeding, WIC allocates only 0.6% of its budget toward breastfeeding initiatives. Formula expenses accounted for 11.6% ($850 million) of WIC's 2009 expenses. The inconsistency between WIC's policies that encourage breastfeeding vs. practices that favor formula begs further examination. Research shows consistent success with peer counseling programs among WIC participants; however, little money is budgeted for these programs. Rebates included, WIC spends 25 times more on formula than on breastfeeding initiatives. The American Academy of Nursing Expert Panel on Breastfeeding is calling for a re-evaluation of how these taxpayer dollars are spent. Additionally, the American Academy of Nursing recommends a shift from formula bargaining to an investment in structured peer counseling programs. All WIC programs should offer peer counseling support services that encourage breastfeeding and meet the needs of the families they serve.",

        "abstract": "The federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which began in the 1970s, has undergone revisions in the past several years, including revision to contents of the supplemental food \"packages\" in 2009 based on recommendations provided by an Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee of The National Academies. In 2010, the IOM held a workshop to examine and recommend research priorities for the program. The overall purpose of the current (ie, second) WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study (ITFPS-2) is to conduct a nationally representative, longitudinal study of contemporary WIC infant and toddler feeding practices. This study will update earlier studies and collect information on variations in WIC program components. The study will also assess ways in which WIC may address obesity in early childhood and examine changes in feeding practices that may stem from the 2009 food package revisions. The sample is drawn from the universe of WIC sites nationally, excluding only those with an insufficient volume of eligible participants. Eligibility for the study includes the ability to be interviewed in English or Spanish. Approximately 8000 women and infants are being sampled, and ∼ 4000 are expected to participate. Eligible women are invited to participate during their WIC enrollment visit, and informed consent is sought. The design includes a core sample to be followed until the infant reaches age 2 y and a supplemental sample to be used in some cross-sectional analyses to ensure adequate representation of groups that might be underrepresented in the core sample. Participants will complete up to 11 interviews (core sample) or 4 interviews (supplemental sample) each except for the prenatal interview, which includes a quantitative 24-h recall of food intake for the infant. Eighty sites have been sampled across 26 states and 1 territory. Instruments have been developed and pretested in both English and Spanish, and interviewers have been rigorously trained. Recruitment and interviewing began in July 2013. This study will provide the only current large-sample longitudinal feeding data available on a nationally representative sample of infants in low-income families, and results will be available to inform the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for the 0- to 24-mo age group.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Examine factors associated with retention on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) after 1 year of age. Setting: A large California WIC program. Participants: WIC participants 14 months old (9,632) between July and September, 2016. Main Outcome Measure: Recertification in WIC by 14 months of age. Analysis: Multivariate logistic regression was performed and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to examine factors associated with child retention in WIC at age 14 months. Results: Mothers performing any amount of breastfeeding from 6 to 12 months were more likely than mothers not breastfeeding to recertify their children in WIC at age 14 months. The odds of retention for children fully breastfed from 6 to 12 months was about 3 times higher than for fully formula‐fed children (95% CI, 2.46–3.59). The odds of retention for mostly breastfed children and children fed some breast milk but mostly formula were 1.95 (95% CI, 1.57–2.43) and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.41–2.10) times higher than fully formula‐fed children. Prenatal intention to breastfeed (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16–1.55), online education (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03–1.13), missing benefits (OR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.17–0.21), underredemption of WIC benefits (OR = 0.51, 95% CI, 0.45–0.58), early enrollment in WIC (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09–1.14), number of family members receiving WIC (OR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.14–1.46), English language preference (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.47–0.64), and participation in Medicaid (OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14–1.47) were also associated with retention. Conclusions and Implications: Results from this study suggested there are a number of areas WIC programs may target to promote ongoing participation in the program. These include support for both breastfeeding and non‐breastfeeding women, technology‐based strategies, and targeted outreach to pregnant women, participants who have missed benefits, and participants who have not redeemed their benefits. Research that examines the impact of targeted interventions directed at ≥1 of these areas is essential to help WIC programs maintain contact with children into early childhood.",

        "abstract": "Although breastfeeding (BF) is the recommended way to feed infants, this may be difficult for the low-income women served by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The 2017 recommended revisions to the WIC food packages provide substantial support to both exclusively and partially BF dyads, remove barriers to partial BF choices within the first 30 days postpartum, and increase flexibility in determining the amount of formula offered to partially breastfed infants. When combined with adequate support and tailored counseling, these changes are intended to make it easier for women served by WIC to choose to breastfeed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether participation in the Women, Infants, and Children Program is associated with improved maternal and infant health outcomes among homeless women in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.\n\n\nMETHOD\nAnalyses were based on Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System participants from 31 states/cities in the United States, 2000-2007 (n=272,859). Overall, 4% of women completing the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey were homeless, with 76% participating in the Women, Infants, and Children Program, a federally-funded supplemental nutrition program for low-income women and children less than 5 years old.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong women in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey who reported using the Women, Infants, and Children Program, those experiencing homelessness were older, less educated, less likely to have private health insurance, and more likely to receive government assistance. Homeless women in the Women, Infants, and Children Program compared with those not in the program were significantly more likely to have a higher body mass index, to initiate breastfeeding after delivery, have prenatal care visits, have a longer gestational age, and have a greater infant birth weight.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCharacteristics of homeless pregnant women choosing to participate in the Women, Infants, and Children Program are consistent with the requirements for program participation for women in general. Homeless women accessing the Women, Infants, and Children Program had better maternal and infant health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "For the first time since 1980, the US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food package policies were revised in 2009 to meet the Institute of Medicine's nutrition recommendations. These changes included increases in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy to improve nutrition and health of WIC participants. Our systematic review of the literature assessed the influence that the 2009 WIC food package revisions have had on dietary intake, healthy food and beverage availability, and breastfeeding participation. The systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations. Four electronic databases were searched between April 1 and 30, 2014, for peer-reviewed research. Two reviewers screened the articles, extracted the data, and established inter-rater reliability by discussing and resolving discrepancies. Twenty articles were included that met our inclusion criteria. Nine of the studies analyzed changes in dietary intake, eight examined changes in healthy food and beverage availability, and three evaluated breastfeeding participation exclusively. The review demonstrated an improved dietary intake and an increase in the availability of healthier foods and beverages in authorized WIC stores. The revised food package was also associated with improved dietary intake of WIC participants. Mixed results were demonstrated in regard to improved breastfeeding outcomes. Further research is needed to assess the influence of WIC 2009 food package revisions on breastfeeding outcomes and to make conclusions about broad nutrition-related implications.",

        "abstract": "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) often allows participants to redeem food benefits for various brands at different costs. To aid the program's food cost containment efforts, it is important to understand the individual and store characteristics associated with brand choices. This study used the WIC Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) data for 239,062 Virginia WIC participants' brand choices in infant fruits and vegetables (F&Vs) and whole grain bread in May 2014-February 2015, one of the first such data sets available in the U.S. for research purposes. Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to analyze the choice of higher-priced brands over lower-priced brands. Minority participants were significantly more likely to redeem higher-priced brands of infant F&Vs, but more likely to choose lower-priced brands of bread. Participants shopping in urban stores or midsized stores (with 5-9 registers) were less likely to choose higher-priced brands compared to rural stores or large stores (with 9+ registers). Race/ethnicity and store characteristics may be significant factors in participants' brand choices. The results can help develop interventions that encourage targeted participants to redeem lower-priced but equivalently healthy brands. This may not only help contain WIC program costs, but help participants manage their own non-WIC food expenses as well.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe CDC recommends a targeted strategy for childhood blood lead screening based on participation in federal programs, such as Medicaid and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Yet, there is scarcity of data on blood lead levels (BLLs) among WIC participants.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur objective was to investigate whether children participating in WIC and not enrolled in Medicaid, who have not been targeted in the historical Medicaid-focused screening strategy, have higher BLLs than children in neither of these programs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe analysis included 3,180 children 1-5 y of age in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted in 2007-2014. Log-binomial regression, which allows direct estimation of prevalence ratios, was used to examine associations between WIC participation (in conjunction with Medicaid enrollment) and having BLLs ≥5 μg/dL with adjustment for age (1-2 vs. 3-5 y).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe percentage of children participating in \"WIC only,\" \"Medicaid only,\" \"both WIC and Medicaid,\" and \"neither\" were 18.9%, 10.8%, 25.4%, and 44.9%, respectively. \"WIC only,\" \"Medicaid only,\" and \"both WIC and Medicaid\" children were more likely to have BLLs ≥5 μg/dL than children who were not enrolled in either program, with adjusted prevalence ratios of 3.29 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19, 9.09], 4.56 (95% CI: 2.18, 9.55), and 2.58 (95% CI: 1.18, 5.63).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren participating in WIC but not Medicaid were more likely to have BLLs ≥5 μg/dL than children who were not enrolled in either program. These findings may inform public health recommendations and clinical practice guidelines.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2384",

        "abstract": "Objective Evaluate variation in fruit and vegetable intake by Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participation and poverty status among pregnant, and postpartum women participating in the Infant Feeding Practice Study II (IFPSII). Methods IFPSII (2005–2007) followed US women from third trimester through 1 year postpartum through mailed questionnaires measuring income, WIC participation, breastfeeding; and dietary history questionnaires (DHQ) assessing prenatal/postnatal fruit and vegetable consumption. Poverty measurements used U.S. Census Bureau Federal Poverty thresholds to calculate percent of poverty index ratio (PIR) corresponding to WIC’s financial eligibility (≤185 % PIR). Comparison groups: WIC recipients; WIC eligible (≤185 % PIR), but non-recipients; and women not financially WIC eligible (>185 % PIR). IFPSII participants who completed at least one DHQ were included. Intake variation among WIC/poverty groups was assessed by Kruskal–Wallis tests and between groups by Mann–Whitney Wilcoxon tests and logistic regression. Mann–Whitney Wilcoxon tests examined postnatal intake by breastfeeding. Results Prenatal vegetable intake significantly varied by WIC/poverty groups (p = 0.04) with WIC recipients reporting significantly higher intake than women not financially WIC eligible (p = 0.02); association remained significant adjusting for confounders [odds ratio 0.66 (95 % confidence interval: 0.49–0.90)]. Prenatal fruit and postnatal consumption did not significantly differ by WIC/poverty groups. Postnatal intake was significantly higher among breastfeeding than non-breastfeeding women (fruit: p < 0.0001; vegetable: p = 0.006). Conclusions for Practice Most intakes did not significantly differ by WIC/poverty groups and thus prompts research on WIC recipient’s dietary behaviors, reasons for non-participation in WIC, and the influence of the recent changes to the WIC food package.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that children and adolescents should have access to safe and healthy foods that promote physical, cognitive, and social growth and development. Federally funded nutrition assistance programs, such as food assistance, meal service, and nutrition education, play a vital role in ensuring that children and adolescents have access to the foods they need and in improving the overall nutrition and health environments of communities. Federally funded nutrition assistance programs help to ensure that children and adolescents receive safe, healthy foods that provide adequate energy and nutrients to meet their growth and development needs. These programs provide access to adequate food supplies to combat hunger and food insecurity; provide healthy foods to children and adolescents who have nutritional or medical risk factors, such as iron deficiency anemia; and provide nutrition education. In addition, federally funded nutrition assistance programs serve as a means to prevent or reduce obesity and other chronic diseases. It is important that permanent and full federal funding be provided for these programs, which have been consistently shown to have a positive impact on child and adolescent nutrition and health outcomes. Registered dietitian nutritionists and nutrition and dietetic technicians, registered-trained in food science, nutrition, and food systems to implement programs to monitor, evaluate, and improve the nutritional status of children and adolescents-are preeminently qualified to implement and evaluate nutrition assistance programs for children and adolescents.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the geographic distribution of healthy food retailers in Washington State and estimate the number of Washington State residents with restricted availability of healthy food. Methods: Street network service areas were drawn around Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infant, and Children retailers for multiple drive times and walking distances in urban and rural Washington State. Population characteristics inside and outside each service area were examined. Results: Nearly all Washington State residents in urban areas lived within a 10‐minute drive of a Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infant, and Children retailer. Among rural residents, 4.6% were in census blocks outside a 20‐minute drive, but the populations were dispersed. Differential access related to income was attributable to a lack of transportation. Conclusions and Implications: Disparities in nutrition described in the published literature may not be due to the geographic distribution of healthy food retailers. Programs for improving nutrition should consider broader interventions to increase access to healthy food.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis study examined the association between participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and adherence to 4 American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on infant feeding.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, which is nationally representative of children born in 2001. We estimated regression models to assess relationships between program participation and adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on exclusive breastfeeding and the introduction of infant formula, cow's milk, and solid foods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRegression results indicated that WIC participation was associated with a 5.9-percentage point decrease in the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding for > or = 4 months and a 1.9-percentage point decrease in the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding for > or = 6 months. Program mothers were 8.5 percentage points less likely than nonparticipants to adhere to the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to delay introduction of infant formula until month 6. Program mothers were 2.5 percentage points more likely than nonparticipants to delay the introduction of cow's milk until month 8. Program participants were 4.5 percentage points less likely than nonparticipants to delay the introduction of solid foods for > or = 4 months. However, the difference between participants and nonparticipants disappeared by month 6.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults suggest that, although program participants are less likely to breastfeed exclusively than eligible nonparticipants, program-provided infant formula is an important option for mothers who do not breastfeed exclusively. The program faces the challenge to encourage breastfeeding without undermining incentives to follow other recommended infant feeding practices. Recent changes proposed to the food packages by the US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service are consistent with the goal of increasing adherence to recommended infant feeding practices among participants.",

To aid the program's food cost containment efforts, it is important to understand the individual and store characteristics associated with brand choices. This study used the WIC Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) data for 239,062 Virginia WIC participants' brand choices in infant fruits and vegetables (F&Vs) and whole grain bread in May 2014-February 2015, one of the first such data sets available in the U.S. for research purposes. Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to analyze the choice of higher-priced brands over lower-priced brands. Minority participants were significantly more likely to redeem higher-priced brands of infant F&Vs, but more likely to choose lower-priced brands of bread. Participants shopping in urban stores or midsized stores (with 5-9 registers) were less likely to choose higher-priced brands compared to rural stores or large stores (with 9+ registers). Race/ethnicity and store characteristics may be significant factors in participants' brand choices. The results can help develop interventions that encourage targeted participants to redeem lower-priced but equivalently healthy brands. This may not only help contain WIC program costs, but help participants manage their own non-WIC food expenses as well.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo describe the prevalence and secular trends of high weight-for-length among infants (ages, 3-23 months) in the biennial US Department of Agriculture Women, Infants, and Children Program and Participants Characteristic (WIC-PC) Survey from 2000 through 2014 (n = 16 927 120).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWeight-for-length was considered to be \"high\" if it was ≥2 SDs above the sex- and age-specific median in the World Health Organization growth standards. Poisson regression was used to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe overall prevalence of high weight-for-length increased from 13.4% in 2000 to 14.5% in 2004, remained constant until 2010, and then decreased by >2 percentage points (to 12.3%) through 2014. The prevalence of high weight-for-length was associated with sex (higher among boys), race-ethnicity (highest among American Indians/Alaskan Natives), and with both age (positive) and family income (inverse). The secular trends, however, were fairly similar within categories of these variables. From 2010 to 2014, the prevalence of high weight-for-length decreased in 40 states and 3 (of 5) US territories, with the largest decreases seen in Puerto Rico (-9 percentage points) and Kentucky (-7 percentage points), and the largest increase (+2 percentage points) seen in West Virginia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough the current results cannot be considered representative of infants in the populations, the prevalence of a high weight-for-length has decreased among infants in WIC-PC since 2010. These decreases were similar across categories of most characteristics, but there were substantial differences across jurisdictions, possibly reflecting differences in policy and local programs that target maternal and infant health.",

Barriers to implementing programs included perceived attitudes of participants, transportation, time, cultural issues, and childcare. Staff BMIs were significantly correlated to ethnicity, age, feeling overweight, unhappiness with current weight, and comfort level discussing fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity (P < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nStaff training, health promotion programs, and culturally relevant educational materials are warranted for WIC staff to build a strong knowledge base and promote self-efficacy about childhood overweight-related topics.",

        "abstract": "Background: Multiple datasets collect breastfeeding data in the United States (US), but a coordinated monitoring and surveillance system does not currently exist. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) reaches over 50% of all infants in the US and provides a potential wealth of administrative data about the breastfeeding practices of low-income women. Objective: The objective of this research was to assess whether WIC administrative data are a valid source of information about breastfeeding practices. Methods: A phone survey of 2015 postpartum WIC mothers in Southern California was conducted to assess the feeding practices of mothers with infants 2-12 months old. Survey data were linked with WIC administrative records from the same month in order to assess the percent agreement between feeding behavior as reported by survey methods and as documented in WIC administrative records. Results: The unweighted κ test statistic was used to test the agreement between survey responses and WIC administrative data. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was found between the two measures. Conclusions: WIC administrative data are a valid source of information about breastfeeding. With appropriate funding support, WIC administrative data should be considered for use in nationwide breastfeeding surveillance and monitoring systems.",

Results Among women who accepted referral into a PC program, odds of initiation were significantly higher among those who received peer services (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.66; 95% CI 1.19–2.32), after adjusting for confounders. Women who received peer services had a significantly lower hazard of breastfeeding discontinuation from birth through 12 months postpartum than women who did not receive services. (Hazard Ratio (HR) month one: 0.45; 95% CI 0.33–0.61; months two through twelve: 0.33; 95% CI 0.18–0.60). The effect of peer counseling did not differ significantly by race and ethnicity, taking into account mother’s country of origin. Conclusion for practice Receipt of peer services was positively associated with breastfeeding initiation and continued breastfeeding from birth through 12 months postpartum. Making peer services available to more women, especially in communities with low initiation and duration, could improve maternal and child health in Minnesota.",

Difficulty using new checks was reported by 13.7% of participants. Compared with English-speaking participants, a higher percentage of Spanish speakers reported satisfaction (P < .01) and a lower percentage reported difficulties using checks (P < .001). A higher percentage of newer enrollees reported satisfaction compared with those participating in WIC before the revisions (P < .01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nThis research suggests that recent policy change to the WIC food package improves WIC participant access to healthful food options without decreasing satisfaction.",

        "abstract": "Background Peer counseling (PC) has been associated with increased breastfeeding initiation and duration, but few analyses have examined the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) model for peer counseling or the continuation of breastfeeding from birth through 12 months postpartum. Objectives Identify associations between Minnesota WIC Peer Breastfeeding Support Program services and breastfeeding initiation and continuation. Methods Retrospective analysis of observational data from the Minnesota WIC program’s administrative database of women who gave birth in 2012 and accepted a PC program referral prenatally (n = 2219). Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression models examined associations between peer services and breastfeeding initiation and continuation of any breastfeeding. Results Among women who accepted referral into a PC program, odds of initiation were significantly higher among those who received peer services (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.66; 95% CI 1.19–2.32), after adjusting for confounders. Women who received peer services had a significantly lower hazard of breastfeeding discontinuation from birth through 12 months postpartum than women who did not receive services. (Hazard Ratio (HR) month one: 0.45; 95% CI 0.33–0.61; months two through twelve: 0.33; 95% CI 0.18–0.60). The effect of peer counseling did not differ significantly by race and ethnicity, taking into account mother’s country of origin. Conclusion for practice Receipt of peer services was positively associated with breastfeeding initiation and continued breastfeeding from birth through 12 months postpartum. Making peer services available to more women, especially in communities with low initiation and duration, could improve maternal and child health in Minnesota.",

Difficulty using new checks was reported by 13.7% of participants. Compared with English-speaking participants, a higher percentage of Spanish speakers reported satisfaction (P < .01) and a lower percentage reported difficulties using checks (P < .001). A higher percentage of newer enrollees reported satisfaction compared with those participating in WIC before the revisions (P < .01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nThis research suggests that recent policy change to the WIC food package improves WIC participant access to healthful food options without decreasing satisfaction.",

The assessment of 'relevance' was deliberately broad to ensure that reviewers remained open to new ideas from a variety of sources of evidence.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nA combination of evidence synthesis and realist analysis techniques was used to modify, refine and substantiate programme theories, which were constructed as explanatory 'context-mechanism-outcome'-configurations.\n\n\nRESULTS\n38 primary studies were included in this review: four studies on Healthy Start and 34 studies on WIC. Two main outcome strands were identified: dietary improvements (intended) and financial assistance (unintended). Three evidence-informed programme theories were proposed to explain how aspects of context (and mechanisms) may generate these outcomes: the 'relative value' of healthy eating (prioritisation of resources); retailer discretion (pressure to 'bend the rules'); the influence of other family members (disempowerment).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis realist review suggests that some low-income pregnant women may use Healthy Start vouchers to increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables and plain cow's milk, whereas others may use them to reduce food expenditure and save money for other things.",

        "abstract": "The national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program (SNAP) has been successful in reducing food insecurity among low-income Americans. However, the program has also been criticized as unhealthy food choices, and rates of diet-related chronic diseases remain high among SNAP beneficiaries. Recently, several multi-component interventions have targeted SNAP beneficiaries, aiming to improve how benefits are utilized to support a healthful diet. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the breadth of published interventions that have targeted SNAP beneficiaries, and their reported impact on diet and nutrition related outcomes. Using key search terms, a literature search of government and peer review databases was conducted. Twelve unique interventions were identified and categorized based on the type of intervention delivered: 1) monetary incentives 2) nutrition education, and 3) combined nutrition education plus monetary incentives. Across all interventions, monetary interventions showed modest improvements in reported fruit and vegetable intake among SNAP beneficiaries. While nutrition education interventions showed improvement in psychosocial correlates of diet, changes in dietary intake were inconsistent. Combination programs demonstrated the strongest improvements in dietary change among beneficiaries. Variability in types of outcomes measured limits comparability of findings across studies, and our findings calls for further evaluation in this area. This scoping review suggests using financial incentives combined with nutrition education may be effective in improving dietary intake among SNAP beneficiaries. Future research should integrate more robust study designs and consider multiple levels of intervention to effectively change beneficiary habits and in turn, reduce diet related disease in this population.",

        "abstract": "Process evaluations are critical in determining whether outcome evaluations are warranted. This study assessed the extent to which a childhood obesity prevention initiative, NY Fit WIC, was adopted and implemented by the New York State Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Process data came from qualitative telephone interviews of 101 WIC local agency directors, following NY Fit WIC trainings. Activities were summarized and cross-tabulated by target level (i.e. participant, staff, agency or community) and by theoretical construct (i.e. knowledge promotion, skill building, self-efficacy or role modeling). Approximately 528 activities were reported across all WIC agencies. When activities were grouped into similar categories, 123 unique activities were identified. Agencies were more likely to implement physical activity-related activities (67%) than nutrition-related activities (33%). The majority of activities targeted WIC participants (47%) and staff (22%) and focused on skill building/self-efficacy (67%) among participants and on role modeling (61%) among staff. The involvement of all agencies shows a high level of adoption of the initiative. The diverse number of activities suggests that WIC local agencies tailored implementation to match their resources and clients' needs as planned. These results suggest that an outcome evaluation is warranted to determine whether meaningful behavioral changes occurred among WIC participants and staff.",

        "abstract": "The overall goal of this pilot quality improvement (QI) intervention was to (1) assess the feasibility of making a WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) systems-level change that added measurement of maternal weight and discussion of maternal health habits into each postpartum maternal and offspring visit in rural clinics in Colorado and (2) assess the impacts of the intervention on maternal diet, physical activity, and weight status. A mixed-method evaluation approach was used involving the collection of quantitative data (HeartSmartMoms usage reports, manual WIC chart reviews [to calculate screening rates], pre-/postsurveys, and weight status [body mass index]) and qualitative data (focus groups and project team meeting minutes). It was determined it is feasible to make a short-term systems-level change; however, many barriers were encountered in doing so, and the results were not sustained. The QI intervention did decrease participants’ daily consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and maternal weight status (controlling for maternal age and language), but did not improve any other eating/physical activity behaviors. Lessons learned and recommendations to improve the implementation of health promotion interventions aimed at improving postpartum maternal health, which can increase health during the periconceptional phase, and in turn, improve the health outcomes for a child, are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The Institute of Medicine recommended changes in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food packages to help families from diverse populations establish more healthful dietary patterns. A cross-sectional study conducted during summer 2007 included interviews and focus groups with 223 WIC participants throughout Maryland. The objectives were to examine participants' responses to food package changes, to identify racial/ethnic differences, and to assess costs. All participants (100%) consumed fruits and vegetables. They preferred fresh for taste, but many endorsed canned and frozen for convenience and cost. Most women (56%) and children (69%) consumed whole milk and did not want reduced-fat milk. Few participants (13%) consumed soy products and most were uninterested in future consumption. Participants endorsed whole-wheat bread as more healthful and reported that they (59%) and their children (51%) would increase consumption if provided by WIC. Non-Hispanic participants preferred peanut butter over beans, Hispanic participants reported that they (44%) and their children (57%) would consume more beans (substituting for peanut butter) if provided by WIC. There were few differences in preferences between African-American and white participants. Hispanics differed from non-Hispanics in preference for beans and dislike of frozen and canned vegetables, suggesting the importance of choices. The proposed food packages were cost-neutral, except when extensive substitutions with soy products were allowed. By providing fruits and vegetables, reduced-fat options, and increased opportunities for nutrition education, the revised food packages may reduce the risk of obesity among low-income women, infants, and children.",

These programs have been successful in achieving many of their initial goals of improving food purchases, food intake, and/or nutritional status of low-income, vulnerable Americans. The emphasis in these programs has now broadened to also include an obesity prevention focus. Recent changes in program components demonstrate the revised objectives of the program. SNAP, WIC, and NSLP increase economic access to an adequate diet but access alone is unlikely to be the total solution to obesity prevention. An ecological approach, incorporating the nutrition programs, appears to be a more promising strategy to leverage the impact of SNAP, WIC, and NSLP.",

Compared with non-Arab/non-Hispanic families, Arab American WIC families were significantly more likely to use all of their monthly WIC benefits, even after controlling for family characteristics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-3.8).

        "abstract": "Objectives Participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has been associated with lower breastfeeding initiation and duration. This study examines breastfeeding-related factors among WIC participants and nonparticipants that might explain these previous findings. Methods Respondents to the 2007 Infant Feeding Practices Study II who were income-eligible for WIC were categorized as follows: no WIC participation (No-WIC); prenatal participation and infant entry while ≥60 % breastfeeding (WIC BF-high); prenatal participation and infant entry while <60 % breastfeeding (WIC BF-low). Percent breastfeeding was the number of breast milk feeds divided by the total number of liquid feeds. Using propensity scores, we matched WIC BF-high respondents to No-WIC respondents on demographic and breastfeeding factors. We used logistic regression to estimate the impact of WIC participation on breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum in the matched sample. Within-WIC differences were explored. Results Of 743 income-eligible respondents, 293 never enrolled in WIC, 230 were categorized as WIC BF-high, and 220 as WIC BF-low. Compared to matched No-WIC respondents, WIC BF-high respondents had increased odds of breastfeeding at 3 months, though this difference was not statistically significant (OR 1.92; 95 % CI 0.95–3.67; p value 0.07). WIC BF-high respondents were more similar on breastfeeding-related characteristics to No-WIC respondents than to WIC BF-low respondents. Conclusions for Practice Accounting for prenatal breastfeeding intentions and attitudes, we find no negative association between WIC participation and breastfeeding at 3 months postpartum. This is in contrast to prior studies, and highlights the importance of understanding within-WIC differences.",

        "abstract": "Use of nutritional labels in choosing food is associated with healthier eating habits including lower fat intake. Current public health efforts are focusing on the revamping of nutritional labels to make them easier to read and use for the consumer. The study aims to assess the frequency of use of nutritional labels and awareness of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutritional programmes by low-income women including those participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) as surveyed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006. Many low-income women do not regularly use the nutrition facts panel information on the food label and less than half had heard of the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans (38.9%). In multivariate logistic regression, we found that WIC participation was associated with reduced use of the nutrition facts panel in choosing food products [odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.91], the health claims information (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.28) and the information on carbohydrates when deciding to buy a product (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.97) in comparison with WIC eligible non-participants. Any intervention to improve use of nutritional labels and knowledge of the USDA's nutritional programmes needs to target low-income women, including WIC participants. Future studies should evaluate possible reasons for the low use of nutrition labels among WIC participants in comparison with eligible non-participants.",

        "abstract": "t is the position of the American Dietetic Association that children and adolescents should have access to an adequate supply of healthful and safe foods that promote optimal physical, cognitive, and social growth and development. Nutrition assistance programs, such as food assistance and meal service programs and nutrition education initiatives, play a vital role in meeting this critical need. Nutrition assistance programs create a safety net that ensures that children and adolescents at risk for poor nutritional intakes have access to a safe, adequate, and nutritious food supply. Federally funded nutrition assistance programs help ensure that children and adolescents receive meals that provide adequate energy and nutrients to meet their growth and development needs; children and adolescents have access to adequate food supplies; and women, infants, and children who have nutritional or medical risk factors, such as iron-deficiency anemia or overweight, receive supplemental nutritious foods as well as nutrition education. In addition, federally funded nutrition assistance programs serve as a means to combat hunger and food insecurity and as a vehicle for nutrition education and promotion of physical activity designed to prevent or reduce obesity and chronic disease. It is important that continued funding be provided for these programs that have been consistently shown to have a positive influence on child and adolescent well-being. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, are uniquely qualified to design, implement, and evaluate nutrition assistance programs for children and adolescents. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, are the only food and nutrition practitioners with adequate training in food science, nutrition, and food systems to implement research and surveillance programs to monitor, evaluate, and improve the nutritional status of children and adolescents.",

We analyze changes in breastfeeding among WIC participants from the period before to period after implementation of the new food package We used linear regression to analyze data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) in 19 states from 2004 to 2010, the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) in 16 states monthly from January 2007 to October 2010 and the National Immunization Survey (NIS) from all 50 states and the District of Columbia from 2004 to 2010 for evidence of an association between time-series patterns of breastfeeding among women or children who participated in WIC and changes in the new food package. Data from all three sources evidenced steady upward trends in ever breastfed infants on WIC during the study period. In neither PRAMS nor the NIS were trends in breastfeeding after implementation of the new food package statistically different from trends in breastfeeding among low-income women not on WIC. We also uncovered no break in monthly breastfeeding rates by birth cohort associated with new food package in the PedNSS. Rates of ever breastfed children are rising nationally but the increase is not associated with changes in WIC’s new food package as evidenced in national and state surveys of postpartum women.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn 2009, the USDA implemented an interim rule that changed the prescribed foods in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Options for mother and infant dyads include a full breastfeeding package with no infant formula, a partial breastfeeding package with some infant formula, and a full formula package with a smaller postpartum food package for the mother. The changes were designed to encourage WIC mothers to choose breastfeeding for their infants.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe purpose of this study was to measure changes in the following 3 outcomes: WIC food-package assignments, WIC infant formula amounts, and breastfeeding initiation.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe compared outcomes before and after implementation of the interim rule in a national random sample of 17 local WIC agencies (LWAs). The data source was administrative records for 206,092 dyads with an infant aged 0-5 mo in the sampled LWAs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were changes in WIC food-package assignments and infant formula amounts but no change in breastfeeding initiation. For dyads in whom the infant was in his or her birth month, the percentage of mothers who received the partial breastfeeding package fell from 24.7% (preimplementation) to 13.8% (postimplementation), the percentage of mothers who received the full breastfeeding package rose from 9.8% (preimplementation) to 17.1% (postimplementation), and the percentage of mothers who received the full formula package rose from 20.5% (preimplementation) to 28.5% (postimplementation).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter the change, fewer WIC mothers of new infants received the partial breastfeeding package. More WIC mothers received the full breastfeeding package, but more mothers also received the full formula package.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Women with longer, healthier pregnancies have more time to enroll in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), biasing associations between WIC and birth outcomes. We examined the association between WIC and preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and perinatal death (PND) using a fetuses-at-risk approach to address this bias, termed gestational age bias. Methods We linked California Medi-Cal recipients with a singleton live birth or fetal death from the 2010 Birth Cohort to WIC participant data (n = 236,564). We implemented a fetuses-at-risk approach using survival analysis, which compared, in each week of gestation, women whose pregnancies reached the same length and who had the same opportunity to utilize WIC. In each gestational week, we assessed WIC enrollment and the number of food packages redeemed thus far and computed hazard ratios (HR) using survival models with time-varying exposures and effects. Results Adjusting for maternal socio-demographic and health characteristics, WIC enrollment was associated with a lower risk of PTB from week 29–36 (HR29 = 0.71; HR36 = 0.52); LBW from week 26–40 (HR26 = 0.77; HR40 = 0.64); and PND from week 29–43 (HR29 = 0.78; HR43 = 0.69) (p < 0.05). The number of food packages redeemed was associated with a lower risk of PTB from week 27–36 (HR27 = 0.90; HR36 = 0.84); LBW from week 25–42 (HR25 = 0.93; HR42 = 0.88); and PND from week 27–46 (HR27 = 0.94; HR46 = 0.91) (p < 0.05). Conclusions for Practice To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the association between WIC and birth outcomes using this approach. We found that beginning from about 29 weeks, WIC enrollment was associated with a reduced risk of PTB by 29–48 %, LBW by 23–36 %, and PND by 22–31 %.",

        "abstract": "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has enjoyed extraordinary bipartisan support stemming from the widespread belief that research studies have proven that WIC \"works.\" Although some studies suggest real dietary and health improvements, the greatest benefits only apply to WIC's prenatal program (just a small part of the total program). Even here, weaknesses in the research render the findings highly uncertain. The three most significant weaknesses are (1) selection bias, (2) simultaneity bias, and (3) lack of generalizeability. The resulting uncertainty places WIC's possible impacts on infant mortality, prematurity, and birthweight on a range from zero to substantial. For infants, children, and postpartum and breastfeeding mothers, the only impacts seem to be small to modest effects on anemia and nutrient intake. This paper does not argue that WIC's weaknesses justify abandoning or even cutting the program. On the contrary, there should be a sustained effort to make the program more effective. This effort should start with a policy debate about WIC's role and impacts, coupled with a grant of greater flexibility to state and local WIC agencies to open the program to innovation and experimentation. To increase WIC's positive impacts, we propose a series of possible reforms, each to be thoroughly evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Women with longer, healthier pregnancies have more time to enroll in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), biasing associations between WIC and birth outcomes. We examined the association between WIC and preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and perinatal death (PND) using a fetuses-at-risk approach to address this bias, termed gestational age bias. Methods We linked California Medi-Cal recipients with a singleton live birth or fetal death from the 2010 Birth Cohort to WIC participant data (n = 236,564). We implemented a fetuses-at-risk approach using survival analysis, which compared, in each week of gestation, women whose pregnancies reached the same length and who had the same opportunity to utilize WIC. In each gestational week, we assessed WIC enrollment and the number of food packages redeemed thus far and computed hazard ratios (HR) using survival models with time-varying exposures and effects. Results Adjusting for maternal socio-demographic and health characteristics, WIC enrollment was associated with a lower risk of PTB from week 29–36 (HR29 = 0.71; HR36 = 0.52); LBW from week 26–40 (HR26 = 0.77; HR40 = 0.64); and PND from week 29–43 (HR29 = 0.78; HR43 = 0.69) (p < 0.05). The number of food packages redeemed was associated with a lower risk of PTB from week 27–36 (HR27 = 0.90; HR36 = 0.84); LBW from week 25–42 (HR25 = 0.93; HR42 = 0.88); and PND from week 27–46 (HR27 = 0.94; HR46 = 0.91) (p < 0.05). Conclusions for Practice To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the association between WIC and birth outcomes using this approach. We found that beginning from about 29 weeks, WIC enrollment was associated with a reduced risk of PTB by 29–48 %, LBW by 23–36 %, and PND by 22–31 %.",

There were 49,795 children born in North Carolina in 1992 who met the inclusion criteria for the study. Their birth records were linked to Medicaid enrollment and claims files, WIC master files, and the Area Resource File. Our analysis strategy included a logit and OLS two-part model with CPI dollar adjustments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChildren who participated in WIC at ages 1 and 2 years had significantly less dentally related expenditures than those who did not participate. WIC participation at age 3 years did not have a significant effect. Fewer WIC children received dental care under general anesthesia than non-WIC children.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe WIC program has the potential for decreasing dentally related costs to the Medicaid program, while increasing use of dental services.",

The National WIC Breastfeeding Peer Counselor Survey was distributed to a convenience sample of state WIC breastfeeding coordinators and breastfeeding project coordinators and to a sample of local agency WIC directors and staff, breastfeeding peer counselor coordinators, and peer counselors. The findings indicate that respondents in the WIC state and local organizations perceive peer counseling to be effective in promoting and sustaining breastfeeding among WIC mothers. There is, however, a lack of consistent policies and procedures concerning the recruitment, training, and counseling phases of peer counseling within and across state WIC agencies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefit use across Arab American, Hispanic, and non-Arab/non-Hispanic families participating in the Michigan WIC program using point-of-sale Electronic Benefits Transfer data.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional analysis using administrative data obtained from the Michigan WIC program, which collects Arab American ethnicity in addition to Hispanic ethnicity and race.\n\n\nSETTING\nMichigan.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nFamilies participating in the Michigan WIC program in March, 2012 (n = 152,989).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nFamilies redeeming all WIC benefits.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nBivariate frequencies and multivariate logistic regression model identified characteristics of families associated with full redemption of WIC food benefits.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAbout 12% of WIC families fully redeemed their benefits in March, 2012. Compared with non-Arab/non-Hispanic families, Arab American WIC families were significantly more likely to use all of their monthly WIC benefits, even after controlling for family characteristics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-3.8). Rates of redemption for Hispanic families, however, were the same as for non-Arab/non-Hispanic families (adjusted odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.0).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nState WIC programs moving toward implementation of Electronic Benefits Transfer should consider ways to enhance systems that would allow for more opportunities to conduct targeted analyses of benefit use across participant subpopulations. Findings point to low overall WIC benefit use. Additional research is needed to explore methods to increase benefit use among all WIC populations, including whether specific factors may contribute to higher redemptions among ethnic minorities, and whether they can be translated to other subpopulations.",

        "abstract": "To address the dual problem of food insecurity and poor nutrition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has recently revised the nutrition standards for nearly all of its federal food programs to align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. One notable exception is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Policy proposals to restrict SNAP benefits based on nutrition quality (e.g., excluding sugary drinks) have generated controversy and have polarized previous research and advocacy allies. This essay presents many of the issues that have emerged, which include challenges about the feasibility, justification, and effectiveness of restricting benefits; the risk of a slippery slope; concerns about participant dignity; and finally, distrust about the motives behind promoting and opposing a policy change. The purpose of this review is to increase mutual understanding and respect of different perspectives. The conclusion is that the rationales behind both support and opposition to updating the policies regulating SNAP benefits based on nutrition are fundamentally the same-the belief that a fair and just society cares for and protects vulnerable citizens, which in this case are low-income Americans who need assistance affording healthy food. Recommendations include activities to restore trust between the public health and anti-hunger communities, authentic engagement of SNAP participants in the conversation, and an optional SNAP program that includes both incentives and restrictions.",

        "abstract": "People of all ages are increasingly consuming larger portions of food. Governments worldwide are involved in the regulation of many aspects of the food supply; however, policies and programs related to serving sizes for children vary or are not clearly communicated. This paper reviews U.S. federal and state government recommendations, policies, and laws related to serving size for children and suggests directions for future policy objectives and outstanding research needed to support the enactment of laws based on the best science. Specifically, this paper reviews federal dietary recommendations and requirements for nutrition programs, packaged food labels and restaurant menus; state regulation of retail environments and child care settings; food companies' self-regulatory options; and directions for future research and policy initiatives. The paper concludes that there are many opportunities for government to revise its policies and programs to better support healthy portion sizes for children and create a more transparent information environment to assist caretakers to do the same.",

        "abstract": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) is the federal government's largest form of food assistance, and a frequent focus of political and scholarly debate. Previous discourse in the public health community and recent proposals in state legislatures have suggested limiting the use of SNAP benefits on unhealthy food items, such as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). This paper identifies two possible underlying motivations for item restriction, health and morals, and analyzes the level of empirical support for claims about the current state of the program, as well as expectations about how item restriction would change participant outcomes. It also assesses how item restriction would reduce individual agency of low-income individuals, and identifies mechanisms by which this may adversely affect program participants. Finally, this paper offers alternative policies to promote healthier purchasing and eating among SNAP participants that can be pursued without reducing individual agency. Health advocates and officials must more fully weigh the attendant risks of implementing SNAP item restrictions, including the reduction of individual agency of a vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "This research assessed the implementation of strategies piloted at 10 Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) clinics aimed at increasing retention in the program, by enhancing participants' shopping experiences. Under WIC Retention Promotion Study: Keep, Reconnect, Thrive (WIC RPS), clinics were recruited and assigned to implement one or a combination of strategies: a standardized Shopping Orientation (SO) curriculum, a Guided Shopping Tour (GST), and a Pictorial Foods Card (PFC) from November 2012 through August 2013. This paper presents results from the process evaluation of the retention strategies, using a mixed-methods comparative case study design employing WIC administrative data, interviews, and focus groups. Qualitative data were inductively coded, analyzed and mapped to the following implementation constructs: organizational capacity, fidelity, allowable adaptations, implementation challenges, and participant responsiveness, while quantitative data were analyzed using SAS to assess reach and dose. Several sites implemented the SO and PFC interventions with the necessary fidelity and dose needed to assess impact on participants' shopping experiences. Sites that were assigned the GST strategy struggled to implement this strategy. However, use of the standardized SO enabled staff to use a \"consistent list of shopping tips\" to educate participants about the proper use of checks, while use of the PFC increased participants' awareness of the variety of WIC-allowable foods. During follow-up telephone calls, 91 percent of participants reported the shopping tips as helpful. Future analyses will assess the impact of enhanced shopping experience on retention at intervention sites.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) was implemented to improve the health of pregnant women and children of low socioeconomic status. In 2009, the program was revised to provide a wider variety of healthy food choices (eg, fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain items).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate (1) the impact of the revised WIC Nutrition Program's food allocation package on the availability, accessibility, and affordability of healthy foods in WIC-authorized grocery stores in Texas; and (2) how the impact of the policy change differed by store types and between rural and urban regions.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWIC-approved stores (n=105) across Texas were assessed using a validated instrument (88 items). Pre- (June-September 2009) and post-new WIC package implementation (June-September 2012) audits were conducted. Paired-sample t tests were conducted to compare the differences between pre- and post-implementation audits on shelf width and number of varieties (ie, availability), visibility (ie, accessibility), and inflation-adjusted price (ie, affordability).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAcross the 105 stores, post-implementation audits showed increased availability in terms of shelf space for most key healthy food options, including fruit (P<0.001), vegetables (P<0.01), cereal (P<0.001), and varieties of vegetables (P<0.001). Food visibility increased for fresh juices (P<0.001). Visibility of WIC labeling improved for foods such as fruits (P<0.05), WIC cereal (P<0.05), and whole-grain or whole-wheat bread (P<0.01). Inflation-adjusted prices decreased only for bread (P<0.001) and dry grain beans (P<0.001). The positive effects of the policy change on food availability and visibility were observed in stores of different types and in different locations, although smaller or fewer effects were noted in small stores and stores in rural regions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImplementation of the revised WIC food package has generally improved availability and accessibility, but not affordability, of healthy foods in WIC-authorized stores in Texas. Future studies are needed to explore the impact of the revised program on healthy food option purchases and consumption patterns among Texas WIC participants.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To date, little is known regarding the impact of maternal depression on participation in public benefit programs. This study examines whether maternal depression is predictive of lower WIC participation in early childhood. Methods This was a secondary data analysis using weighted data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort. Maternal data collected when children were 9 and 24 months of age were used. 9 months was considered baseline, and 24 months was considered follow-up. The study cohort consisted of 3841 low income mothers, defined as <185 % federal poverty level, who reported WIC participation at baseline. Baseline maternal depressive symptoms were measured by a 12-item abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. WIC participation was assessed by maternal self-report. Results At baseline, 24.5 % of mothers were depressed (raw score >9). The majority of mothers were white, unemployed, and born in the US. Most received Medicaid (74 %) and almost half received SNAP (47 %). At follow-up, 80.1 % of mothers reported WIC participation. In multivariable analysis, maternal depression at baseline was significantly associated with decreased WIC participation at follow-up (aOR 0.74; 95 % CI 0.55–0.99). Conclusions Our results suggest that maternal depression is an independent risk factor for decreased WIC participation in low-income families with young children. Primary and secondary prevention strategies aimed at maternal depression may positively impact low-income families’ participation in public benefit programs. Further longitudinal and interventional studies are needed in order to inform clinical practice and public health policy.",

Caregivers and children who usually consumed whole milk decreased by 15.7 and 19.7 percentage points, respectively, a 60%-63% reduction over baseline. Accompanying increases in lower-fat milk consumption were demonstrated. Small but significant increases in consumption of fruits and vegetables were also observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nFederal policy changes to the WIC program had the intended effect of increasing consumption of the prescribed food items.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLiterature on food environments is expanding rapidly, yet a gap exists regarding the role of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) on healthy food availability. In October 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture revised the WIC food package, requiring certified stores to stock fresh produce, whole grains, and lower-fat milk.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThe goal of this study is to compare availability of foods in stores that are versus those that are not WIC-certified before and after the policy change.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStore inventories were collected in 45 corner stores in Hartford CT with four inventories each (180 total inventories) from January 2009 to January 2010. Data on availability and variety of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, whole grains, and lower-fat milk were recorded. Analyses were completed in 2012 using Fisher's exact test, chi-square, and t-tests for descriptive analyses and multilevel models to measure food availability longitudinally (significance at p<0.05).\n\n\nRESULTS\nControlling for covariates, WIC-certified vendors carried more varieties of fresh fruit (p<0.01); a greater proportion of lower-fat milk (p<0.01); and had greater availability of whole grain bread (p<0.01) and brown rice (p<0.05) than vendors without WIC authorization after the policy change. Conversely, for all outcomes, stores without WIC authorization did not significantly increase healthy food availability.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe 2009 WIC revisions increased availability of healthy foods among WIC-certified vendors compared to those without WIC authorization in Hartford CT. For many residents without a car, these changes can create a convenient shopping location for healthy foods when a larger supermarket is not nearby.",

        "abstract": "Given the prevalence and consequences of childhood obesity, efforts are being made to identify risk factors and design evidence-based interventions to reduce its impact. Food and beverage consumption habits are established early in life, making preschool-age children an important group to focus on. This cross-sectional study explored beverage intake and its association with body weight status among low-income preschool-age children enrolled in the Special Supplementation Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Authorized representatives for children between the ages of 3 and 4.9 years were interviewed at WIC clinics in Broward County, Florida. Anthropometric data were collected from the WIC data system. The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), particularly fruit drinks, was significantly higher in overweight/obese children when compared with their under/normal weight counterparts. Independent of body weight status, the preschool-age children were consuming on average over twice as much as the recommended intake of 100% fruit juice per day for that age group. Close to 80% of the overweight/obese children consumed low-fat or fat-free milk most often than any other type of milk. The intake of SSB was positively correlated with both the intakes of 100% fruit juice and milk, and negatively correlated with the intake of water. When body weight status, race/ethnicity, and intake of other beverages were held constant, SSB intake was positively associated with milk intake and negatively associated with water intake. Results from this study support the need to encourage water intake and discourage SSB intake in an effort to reduce the risk for overweight and obesity in WIC-participating preschool-age children. Emphasizing the need to follow the recommendation to limit 100% fruit juice intake to 4 to 6 oz. per day is important when counseling families with young children. Efforts to increase awareness of the health consequences associated with consuming high-fat milk should continue.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the readiness of the Western Region Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) states to implement participant-centered nutrition education (PCE) and to develop a PCE model for WIC service delivery.\n\n\nDESIGN\nFormative research including on-line survey, qualitative in-depth interviews, focus groups, and observational assessments.\n\n\nSETTING\nWIC clinics within the Western Region WIC states.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nState and local staff and WIC clients within 8 states, 2 tribal organizations, and 2 territories.\n\n\nPHENOMENON OF INTEREST\nReadiness indicators of states to implement and expand PCE elements to include in PCE model development.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nOn-line surveys were collected and analyzed. On-site assessment forms, interviews, and focus group findings were collected, coded, and summarized by themes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nKey themes from state and local findings guided the model development for PCE implementation in the Western Region WIC states. The PCE model must be flexible and systems oriented, contain strong training and mentoring components, and integrate cultural sensitivity to best reach program participants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nThe PCE model has the potential to improve WIC nutrition services and enable participants to make positive health-related behavior changes that will influence long-term health issues. Further outcome studies are needed to determine the success of PCE implementation in the Western Region WIC states.",

        "abstract": "Food security and health are complex interrelated issues. Individual characteristics exist within the physical and built environments. Title IV of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 is analyzed in terms of how it addresses systemic food insecurity and the opportunities the policy has for improving public health by increasing support for the availability of affordable local produce to low-income households. Structural changes need to occur for programs to be equitable, efficient, and effective. Interdisciplinary leadership within government agencies, school systems, social service agencies, health care agencies, and nonprofit networks is necessary to ensure food security and health for all Americans. Social work and public health practitioners have the opportunity to change the status quo, encourage community-level interventions, advocate for producers and consumers, and encourage more equitable distribution of food to create a healthier low-income population.",

The intervention was most protective for children younger than 2 years of age.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nAlthough the impact of the intervention was relatively small and limited to the youngest children served by WIC, findings suggest that the WIC setting is appropriate for improving healthful behaviors that are linked to reducing the rates of early childhood overweight.",

Each agency independently recruited mothers for participation. Apart from selecting only mothers, no other exclusion criteria were applied.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nAn FTW learner-centered fruit and vegetable class.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nAn analytic team independently reviewed transcripts and coded themes. The long-table analytic approach was used to categorize results. Results from intervention and comparison groups were compared and ranked to create a textual summary.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe most significant difference between the intervention and comparison groups' reports was that intervention participants identified more value, importance, and relevance of the fruit and vegetable information and adopting new fruit and vegetable practices after attending the class.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nCalifornia WIC demonstrated that messages delivered through this process can be retained and integrated into family life practices.",

        "abstract": "Under the current version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), participants can purchase virtually any food or beverage (collectively, food). Research indicates that SNAP recipients may have worse dietary quality than income-eligible nonparticipants. Policymakers have urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pilot SNAP purchasing restrictions intended to support a healthier diet, and state legislators have proposed similar bills. The USDA rejected these invitations, stating that it would be administratively and logistically difficult to differentiate among products, amid other concerns. However, the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) do just that. Further, state governments define and differentiate among foods and beverages for tax purposes. This paper reviews several factors intended to inform future policy decisions: the science indicating that SNAP recipients have poorer diet quality than income-eligible nonparticipants; the public's support for revising the SNAP program; federal, state, and city legislators' formal proposals to amend SNAP based on nutrition criteria and the USDA's public position in opposition to these proposals; state bills to amend eligible foods purchasable with SNAP benefits; state retail food tax laws; and the retail administration and program requirements for both WIC and SNAP. The paper finds that the government has a clear ability to align SNAP benefits with nutrition science and operationalize this into law.",

This is a matter of concern because it is known that feeding with infant formula results in worse health outcomes for infants than breastfeeding.DiscussionThe evidence that is available indicates that the WIC program has the effect of promoting the use of infant formula, thus placing infants at higher risk. Moreover, the program violates the widely accepted principles that have been set out in the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and in the human right to adequate food.SummaryThere is no good reason for an agency of government to distribute large quantities of free infant formula. It is recommended that the large-scale distribution of free infant formula by the WIC program should be phased out.",

        "abstract": "When randomization is not possible, researchers must control for non-random assignment to experimental groups. One technique for statistical adjustment for non-random assignment is through the use of a two-stage analytical technique. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of this technique to control for selection bias in examining the effects of the The Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children’s (WIC) on dental visits. From 5 data sources, an analysis file was constructed for 49,512 children ages 1–5 years. The two-stage technique was used to control for selection bias in WIC participation, the potentially endogenous variable. Specification tests showed that WIC participation was not random and that selection bias was present. The effects of the WIC on dental use differed by 36% after adjustment for selection bias by means of the two-stage technique. This technique can be used to control for potential selection bias in dental research when randomization is not possible.",

        "abstract": "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) was established in 1972 by an amendment to the 1966 Child NutritionAct, andbecameapermanentprogram in 1974. Administered federally by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service and typically managed by state health departments, WIC participation greatly expanded since its inception. The program is well recognized as an adjunct to health care during critical times of growth and development and is considered an entry point to other health and social services for low-income families. It serves nutritionally at-risk pregnant, breastfeeding (BF), and postpartum women, infants, and children age <5 years, providing supplemental nutritious food and nutrition education as well as referrals to social and health services. Collective findings of studies, reviews, and reports demonstrated thatWIC is cost-effective in protecting and improving the health and nutritional status of participants. The required nutrition education component is the benefit that sets WIC apart from other federal nutrition assistance programs. Historically, WIC included BF promotion and support as part of its supplemental food and nutrition education programming efforts. BF provides multiple health, nutritional, economical, and emotional benefits to mothers and babies. This led to both the issuance in 2011 of the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding and the establishment of Healthy People 2020 BF goals. Human milk is considered the best source of infant nutrition that also offers immunological and anti-inflammatory properties to protect infants from ear, respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections as well as other health issues. Furthermore, BF protects mothers against diseases such as breast and ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, and postpartum depression. The US Department of Health and Human Service's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects BF data using the US National Immunization Survey. Table 1 lists the 2016 National Immunization Survey data, which indicate that the nation and WIC mothers fell short of the 2020 Healthy People BF goals. However, data from the 2014 WIC Participant and Program Characteristics Report 2014 showed a steady increase in WIC BF initiation rates from 48.3% in 2002 to 68.9% in 2014, indicating that more mothers chose BF as their first choice for infant feeding. Despite all known benefits, mothers enrolled in WIC continue to face multiple barriers in reaching their BF goals. The Social Ecological Model is used to illustrate the intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and institutional levels intricately involved in successful BF. Human milk is the normative standard for infant feeding and nutrition and given that about one half of all US-born infants are enrolled inWIC,theUSDAiscommitted to strengthening efforts to promote and support BF for improved health outcomes. This commentary highlights USDA past national WIC BF activities and reflects on future efforts in BF promotion and support to safeguard the health of all infants and their mothers.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe present study assessed the impact of the 2009 food packages mandated by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) on dietary intake and home food availability in low-income African-American and Hispanic parent/child dyads.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA natural experiment was conducted to assess if the revised WIC food package altered dietary intake, home food availability, weight and various lifestyle measures immediately (6 months) following policy implementation.\n\n\nSETTING\nTwelve WIC clinics in Chicago, IL, USA.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nTwo hundred and seventy-three Hispanic and African-American children aged 2-3 years, enrolled in WIC, and their mothers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix months after the WIC food package revisions were implemented, we observed modest changes in dietary intake. Fruit consumption increased among Hispanic mothers (mean = 0·33 servings/d, P = 0·04) and low-fat dairy intake increased among Hispanic mothers (0·21 servings/d, P = 0·02), Hispanic children (0·34 servings/d, P < 0·001) and African-American children (0·24 servings/d, P = 0·02). Home food availability of low-fat dairy and whole grains also increased. Dietary changes, however, varied by racial/ethnic group. Changes in home food availability were not significantly correlated with changes in diet.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe WIC food package revisions are one of the first efforts to modify the nutrition guidelines that govern foods provided in a federal food and nutrition assistance programme. It will be important to examine the longer-term impact of these changes on dietary intake and weight status.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is generally inversely related to income among women in the United States. Less access to healthy foods is one way lower income can influence dietary behaviors and body weight. Federal food assistance programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), are an important source of healthy food for low-income populations. In 2009, as part of a nationwide policy revision, WIC added a fruit and vegetable (F/V) voucher to WIC food packages. This quasi-experimental study determined whether F/V prices at stores authorized to accept WIC (ie, WIC vendors) decreased after the policy revision in seven Illinois counties. It also examined cross-sectional F/V price variations by store type and neighborhood characteristics. Two pre-policy observations were conducted in 2008 and 2009; one post-policy observation was conducted in 2010. Small pre- to post-policy reductions in some F/V prices were found, particularly for canned fruit and frozen vegetables at small stores. Compared with chain supermarkets, mass merchandise stores had lower prices for fresh F/V and frozen F/V and small stores and non-chain supermarkets had higher canned and frozen F/V prices, but lower fresh F/V prices. Limited price differences were found across neighborhoods, although canned vegetables were more expensive in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of either Hispanics or blacks and fresh F/V prices were lower in neighborhoods with more Hispanics. Results suggest the WIC policy revision contributed to modest reductions in F/V prices. WIC participants' purchasing power can differ depending on the type and neighborhood of the WIC vendor used.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is generally inversely related to income among women in the United States. Less access to healthy foods is one way lower income can influence dietary behaviors and body weight. Federal food assistance programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), are an important source of healthy food for low-income populations. In 2009, as part of a nationwide policy revision, WIC added a fruit and vegetable (F/V) voucher to WIC food packages. This quasi-experimental study determined whether F/V prices at stores authorized to accept WIC (ie, WIC vendors) decreased after the policy revision in seven Illinois counties. It also examined cross-sectional F/V price variations by store type and neighborhood characteristics. Two pre-policy observations were conducted in 2008 and 2009; one post-policy observation was conducted in 2010. Small pre- to post-policy reductions in some F/V prices were found, particularly for canned fruit and frozen vegetables at small stores. Compared with chain supermarkets, mass merchandise stores had lower prices for fresh F/V and frozen F/V and small stores and non-chain supermarkets had higher canned and frozen F/V prices, but lower fresh F/V prices. Limited price differences were found across neighborhoods, although canned vegetables were more expensive in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of either Hispanics or blacks and fresh F/V prices were lower in neighborhoods with more Hispanics. Results suggest the WIC policy revision contributed to modest reductions in F/V prices. WIC participants' purchasing power can differ depending on the type and neighborhood of the WIC vendor used.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nFood security is the ability to access sufficient food to maintain a healthy, active life. Previous studies link food insecurity with adverse health outcomes. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of food insecurity, identify sociodemographic risk factors, and quantify receipt of public nutrition assistance among recently hospitalized children in the United States.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCross-sectional analyses of a representative sample of the US population aged 0 to 19 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007 to 2012 (N = 12,627). Consistent with previous literature, households were defined as food insecure if they answered \"yes\" to 3 or more of 18 food security questions. Children were considered recently hospitalized if admitted overnight in the past year (n = 706). Descriptive statistics characterized food insecurity and receipt of nutrition assistance. Multiple logistic regression analyses evaluated associations of food insecurity with age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, family income, and hospitalization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne-quarter (25.3%) of recently hospitalized children lived in food insecure households. More than one-third of recently hospitalized low-income, uninsured, or Hispanic children lived in food insecure households. In the adjusted analysis, recently hospitalized low-income children and girls had significantly greater odds of living in food insecure households. Of potentially eligible hospitalized children, 26.9% had not received Women, Infants, and Children benefits and 31.0% had not received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the past year.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOne-quarter of recently hospitalized children lived in food insecure households. Many eligible families were not enrolled in public nutrition programs. Hospitalization represents a potential opportunity to identify these children and help families access nutrition assistance.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nBeginning in 1990, Georgia's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) initiated 5 new strategies to promote breastfeeding among its pregnant and postpartum clients. These strategies were implemented in 1991, each to be provided as an addition to its standard program of counseling on breastfeeding and distributing appropriate literature: 1) enhanced breastfeeding education, 2) breast pump loans, 3) hospital-based programs, 4) peer counseling, and 5) community coalitions. The enhanced breastfeeding education strategy provides access to a hotline as well as periodic training of staff, and the breast pump loan provides free breast pumps to mothers who want to use them. The hospital-based strategy provides bedside support and counseling to women who have just given birth and includes staff training, as well as a hotline number for women to call after they leave the hospital. The peer-counseling strategy focuses on identifying former WIC participants who have successfully breastfed their infants; these women are recruited to provide support and encouragement to current WIC participants. Finally, the community coalitions approach is designed to identify existing community attitudes about breastfeeding, establish plans to address gaps in breastfeeding services, to develop resource guides on breastfeeding for the community, and to advocate at the community level to support breastfeeding women. The objective of our research was to evaluate the impact of breastfeeding promotion strategies on breastfeeding initiation among WIC participants in Georgia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing data from the Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System (PNSS) for 1992-1996, we examined breastfeeding initiation rate during this period and compared rates among 6 different intervention strategies. Also, we used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) to assess breastfeeding initiation and duration among WIC enrollees. We conducted 13 focus groups to understand the experiences of program participants. Ten focus groups were conducted with women who were breastfeeding their infants, 3 each with women from the community coalitions, hospital-based programs, and standard education programs, and 1 with women from the breast pump loan program. Three focus groups were conducted with women who were feeding their infants formula.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPNSS data show that breastfeeding initiation increased in the Georgia WIC program from 31.6% in 1992 to 39.5% in 1996. PRAMS data confirmed the increase in breastfeeding initiation from 33.6% (standard error [SE]: 2.2) in 1993 to 42.1% (SE: 2.4) in 1996 among WIC participants. Both datasets (PRAMS and PNSS) showed breastfeeding initiation to be well below the year 2000 goal of 75%. Overall, PRAMS data show a high breastfeeding initiation among non-WIC participants (range: 64.7% [SE: 2.2]) for 1994 to 70.1% (SE: 2.2) in 1996. The percent change between 1993 and 1996 was 8% for non-WIC participants, and it was 25% for the WIC participants among those responding to the PRAMS questionnaire. Data from PRAMS indicated no statistical change in the percentage of WIC enrollees who breastfed their infants for 8 weeks or more; this estimate was 18.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.9-21.8) in 1993 and 19.4% (95% CI: 15.7-23.2) in 1996, well below the Healthy People 2000 objective of 50% at 6 months. According to PNSS data, the largest increases in breastfeeding initiation for 1992 to 1996 were among younger women (</=19 and 20-24 years old), those with no college (less than high school and high school only), unmarried, and black women (see Table 1). The smallest increases during this period were among older women (30+), those with more than a high school education, and women who were white, Hispanic, or from other ethnic or racial groups. The PRAMS data (1993-1996) generally display similar results, but the pattern by marital status demonstrated larger increases for married women than for unmarried women.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nBeginning in 1990, Georgia's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) initiated 5 new strategies to promote breastfeeding among its pregnant and postpartum clients. These strategies were implemented in 1991, each to be provided as an addition to its standard program of counseling on breastfeeding and distributing appropriate literature: 1) enhanced breastfeeding education, 2) breast pump loans, 3) hospital-based programs, 4) peer counseling, and 5) community coalitions. The enhanced breastfeeding education strategy provides access to a hotline as well as periodic training of staff, and the breast pump loan provides free breast pumps to mothers who want to use them. The hospital-based strategy provides bedside support and counseling to women who have just given birth and includes staff training, as well as a hotline number for women to call after they leave the hospital. The peer-counseling strategy focuses on identifying former WIC participants who have successfully breastfed their infants; these women are recruited to provide support and encouragement to current WIC participants. Finally, the community coalitions approach is designed to identify existing community attitudes about breastfeeding, establish plans to address gaps in breastfeeding services, to develop resource guides on breastfeeding for the community, and to advocate at the community level to support breastfeeding women. The objective of our research was to evaluate the impact of breastfeeding promotion strategies on breastfeeding initiation among WIC participants in Georgia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing data from the Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System (PNSS) for 1992-1996, we examined breastfeeding initiation rate during this period and compared rates among 6 different intervention strategies. Also, we used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) to assess breastfeeding initiation and duration among WIC enrollees. We conducted 13 focus groups to understand the experiences of program participants. Ten focus groups were conducted with women who were breastfeeding their infants, 3 each with women from the community coalitions, hospital-based programs, and standard education programs, and 1 with women from the breast pump loan program. Three focus groups were conducted with women who were feeding their infants formula.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPNSS data show that breastfeeding initiation increased in the Georgia WIC program from 31.6% in 1992 to 39.5% in 1996. PRAMS data confirmed the increase in breastfeeding initiation from 33.6% (standard error [SE]: 2.2) in 1993 to 42.1% (SE: 2.4) in 1996 among WIC participants. Both datasets (PRAMS and PNSS) showed breastfeeding initiation to be well below the year 2000 goal of 75%. Overall, PRAMS data show a high breastfeeding initiation among non-WIC participants (range: 64.7% [SE: 2.2]) for 1994 to 70.1% (SE: 2.2) in 1996. The percent change between 1993 and 1996 was 8% for non-WIC participants, and it was 25% for the WIC participants among those responding to the PRAMS questionnaire. Data from PRAMS indicated no statistical change in the percentage of WIC enrollees who breastfed their infants for 8 weeks or more; this estimate was 18.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.9-21.8) in 1993 and 19.4% (95% CI: 15.7-23.2) in 1996, well below the Healthy People 2000 objective of 50% at 6 months.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Fresh Start (WFS) is a randomized controlled trial of nutrition education to promote farmers' market fruit and vegetable (F/V) purchases and consumption among women enrolled in WIC.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo describe the baseline characteristics (demographics and F/V intake [including F/V juice]) of WFS participants, compare the characteristics with those of WIC participants in New Jersey and nationwide, and examine the baseline reliability of study measures.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nSeven hundred forty-four women served by a New Jersey-based WIC agency located in a densely populated, urban area.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nDemographic characteristics; newly developed measures of farmers' market-related knowledge, attitudes, and skills; and validated measures of F/V intake.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES\nDescriptive statistics to characterize the sample. One-sample t and one-sample sign tests to compare the characteristics with reference values. For dietary behaviors, comparisons were with state and national estimates of the frequency and quantity of F/V intake.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants had a mean age of 28.9±6.8 years and were predominantly Hispanic (59%), US-born (60%), never married (41%), unemployed (62%), receiving assistance other than WIC (70%), and food insecure (55%). Half reported a high school education or less. Higher proportions of WFS participants than WIC participants nationwide were represented among demographic groups at increased risk of inadequate F/V intake. WFS participants consumed more fruit (2.7 cups/day) but less vegetables (1.4 cups/day) than did women nationwide (1.1 and 1.4 cups/day, respectively; P<0.01). Although participants consumed recommended amounts of fruit, their vegetable intake was below recommended levels. All but two of the measures developed for the study had reliability coefficients at or above 0.60.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIntervention is warranted to improve participants' vegetable intake. Registered dietitian nutritionists should be aware of F/V intake differences that may require differential intervention strategies.",

Nonparametric Wilcoxon, chi-square, and t test to compare changes in response in intervention versus controls. Analysis of covariance models to test the influence of language preference on outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver 86% of women wanted to substitute some of their milk vouchers with yogurt. Among these, 62% reported preferring yogurt to milk. The majority (89%) redeemed the yogurt coupons. Compared to controls, intervention women reported a trend (P = .09) toward an increase in yogurt intake of 1.0 fl oz/day while not decreasing other dairy consumption. Those in the intervention group with the lowest tertile of yogurt intake at baseline increased yogurt consumption by 2.8 fl oz/day (P = .003) relative to controls with lowest intake.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nYogurt is likely to be a popular substitute for milk and could contribute to increased dairy intake among women if it were an option in WIC.",

        "abstract": "Support for WIC, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, is based on the belief that \"WIC works.\" This consensus has lately been questioned by researchers who point out that most WIC research fails to properly control for selection into the program. This paper evaluates the selection problem using rich data from the national Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. We show that relative to Medicaid mothers, all of whom are eligible for WIC, WIC participants are negatively selected on a wide array of observable dimensions, and yet WIC participation is associated with improved birth outcomes, even after controlling for observables and for a full set of state-year interactions intended to capture unobservables that vary at the state-year level. The positive impacts of WIC are larger among subsets of even more disadvantaged women, such as those who received public assistance last year, single high school dropouts, and teen mothers.",

To determine prevalence of FI, assess the effect public benefits have on FI, assess strategies to stretch nutritional resources (eg, using generic formula), and investigate FI’s relationship to anthropometric measurements. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was completed. FI was classified using the US Department of Agriculture’s 6-item indicator set. Results. A convenience sample of 144 infant caregivers was surveyed. Thirty-one percent endorsed FI. FI was more common among those receiving WIC and SNAP (39% vs 22%; P < .05). Fifteen percent stretched infant formula (27% FI vs 9% food secure; P < .01), 58% would not use generic formula, and 50% believed that generic and brand name formulas were not equivalent. There was no significant association between FI and anthropometric measurements. Conclusions. FI and formula stretching were common, even among families receiving public benefits. Many families were cautious about using generic formula.",

The PSID provides extensive data on the income and well-being of a representative sample of U.S. families from 1968 to present. The CDS collects information on the children in PSID families ranging from cognitive, behavioral, and health status to their family and neighborhood environment. The first two waves of the CDS were conducted in 1997 and 2002, respectively. We use information on 3,181 children and their mothers.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nWe use propensity score matching with multiple imputations to examine whether WIC program influences birth outcomes: birth weight, prematurity, maternal report of the infant's health, small for gestational age, and placement in the neonatal intensive care unit. Furthermore, we use a fixed-effects model to examine the above outcomes controlling for mother-specific unobservables.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nAfter using propensity scores to adjust for confounding factors, WIC shows no statistically significant effects for any of six outcomes. Fixed-effects models, however, reveal some effects that are statistically significant and fairly substantial in size. These involve preterm birth and birth weight.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOverall, the WIC program had moderate effects, but findings were sensitive to the estimation method used.",

        "abstract": "Recent analyses differ on how effective the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is at improving infant health. We use data from nine states that participate in the Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System to address limitations in previous work. With information on the mother's timing of WIC enrollment, we test whether greater exposure to WIC is associated with less smoking, improved weight gain during pregnancy, better birth outcomes, and greater likelihood of breastfeeding. Our results suggest that much of the often reported association between WIC and lower rates of preterm birth is likely spurious, the result of gestational age bias. We find modest effects of WIC on fetal growth, inconsistent associations between WIC and smoking, limited associations with gestational weight gain, and some relationship with breastfeeding. A WIC effect exists, but on fewer margins and with less impact than has been claimed by policy analysts and advocates.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that children ages 2 to 11 years should achieve optimal physical and cognitive development, maintain healthy weights, enjoy food, and reduce the risk of chronic disease through appropriate eating habits and participation in regular physical activity. Rapid increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity during the 1980s and 1990s focused attention on young children's overconsumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages and lack of physical activity. While recent data suggest a stabilization of obesity rates, several public health concerns remain. These include the most effective ways to promote healthy weights, the number of children living in food insecurity, the under-consumption of key nutrients, and the early development of diet-related risks for chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, and osteoporosis. This Position Paper reviews what children 2 to 11 years old in the United States are reportedly eating, explores trends in food and nutrient intakes, and examines the impact of federal nutrition programs on child nutrition. Current dietary recommendations and guidelines for physical activity are also discussed. The roles of parents and caregivers in influencing the development of life-long healthy eating behaviors are highlighted. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics works with other allied health and food industry professionals to translate dietary recommendations and guidelines into positive, practical health messages. Specific recommendations and sources of science-based nutrition messages to improve the nutritional well-being of children are provided for food and nutrition practitioners.",

This article describes the development of educational materials for a Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)–based randomized controlled trial of an intervention encouraging timely bottle weaning. Method. Following a systematic process to develop of patient education materials, messages were first tested in 4 focus groups with 26 caregivers of WIC toddlers aged 7 to 36 months of age at the 2 study sites. Following review and revision, the materials were retested in one-on-one nutritional counseling sessions with 10 clients at the WIC sites who met the study’s eligibility criteria. Results. Materials development was an iterative process requiring several levels of input, review, and revision. Use of a systematic process guided by steps adapted from the health education literature was crucial in ensuring continuous feedback from stakeholders, experts, and priority populations and to develop an intervention instrument that met the needs and expectations of all groups. Conclusions and implications. The content, theoretical orientation, and format of the materials were influenced at every turn by feedback from frontline WIC nutritionists, WIC policy staff at the state level, and WIC clients. Development of effective, easy to use materials requires constant input from key stakeholders.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn 2016, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Retailer Rule proposed several changes for SNAP-authorized retailers, including: requiring retailers to have at least 85% of their food sales come from items that are not cooked or heated on site before or after purchase; requiring stores to stock seven varieties of qualifying foods from four staple food groups; requiring stores to carry perishable foods in three of the four staple groups; requiring stores to carry six units of qualifying foods at all times (depth of stock); disqualifying multiple ingredient foods and accessory foods from counting toward depth of stock requirements.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo better understand arguments used to support or oppose the USDA's proposed rule that all SNAP-authorized retailers carry more nutritious foods.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe conducted a qualitative content analysis of a random sample of public comments posted to the US Federal Register (a publicly available database) in response to the USDA's proposed rule.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nA random sample of 20% of all public comments submitted by individuals and organizations to the US Federal Register were analyzed (n=303) for this study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree main themes were discussed: 1) arguments used in opposition to the rule; 2) arguments used in support of the rule; and 3) facilitators to assist stores in implementing the rule. Some of the subthemes included focusing on definitions used in the rule, reduced food access caused by stores leaving the SNAP program, lack of space and equipment for healthy foods, and the potential for increasing healthy food access.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNutrition and dietetics practitioners may be tasked with working with stores to implement healthy changes. Nutrition and dietetics practitioners must understand the role that the USDA has in food policy. In addition, understanding how federal food policy influences the environments in which dietetics professionals' clients are making food choices is important.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, health care systems have addressed gaps in patients' diet quality with programs that provide dietary counseling and education, without addressing food security. However, health care systems increasingly recognize the need to address food security to effectively support population health and the prevention and management of diet-sensitive chronic illnesses. Numerous health care systems have implemented screening programs to identify food insecurity in their patients and to refer them to community food resources to support food security. This article describes barriers encountered and lessons learned from implementation and expansion of the Kaiser Permanente Colorado's clinical food insecurity screening and referral program, which operates in collaboration with a statewide organization (Hunger Free Colorado) to manage clinic-to-community referrals. The immediate goals of clinical screening interventions described in this article are to identify households experiencing food insecurity, to connect them to sustainable (federal) and emergency (community-based) food resources, to alleviate food insecurity, and to improve dietary quality. Additional goals are to improve health outcomes, to decrease health care utilization, to improve patient satisfaction, and to better engage patients in their care.",

        "abstract": "Maternal prenatal nutrition and the child's nutrition in the first 2 years of life (1000 days) are crucial factors in a child's neurodevelopment and lifelong mental health. Child and adult health risks, including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, may be programmed by nutritional status during this period. Calories are essential for growth of both fetus and child but are not sufficient for normal brain development. Although all nutrients are necessary for brain growth, key nutrients that support neurodevelopment include protein; zinc; iron; choline; folate; iodine; vitamins A, D, B6, and B12; and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Failure to provide key nutrients during this critical period of brain development may result in lifelong deficits in brain function despite subsequent nutrient repletion. Understanding the complex interplay of micro- and macronutrients and neurodevelopment is key to moving beyond simply recommending a \"good diet\" to optimizing nutrient delivery for the developing child. Leaders in pediatric health and policy makers must be aware of this research given its implications for public policy at the federal and state level. Pediatricians should refer to existing services for nutrition support for pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, and toddlers. Finally, all providers caring for children can advocate for healthy diets for mothers, infants, and young children in the first 1000 days. Prioritizing public policies that ensure the provision of adequate nutrients and healthy eating during this crucial time would ensure that all children have an early foundation for optimal neurodevelopment, a key factor in long-term health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFood insecurity and anemia are prevalent among low-income families and infants. Anemia may reflect iron deficiency anemia (IDA) risk. IDA in infancy and early childhood may have long-lasting developmental effects. Few studies have examined food security status (FSS) as a risk factor for anemia.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the association between household FSS, sociodemographic and health-related variables, and anemia incidence at age 18 months among low-income infants in the Massachusetts Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (MA/WIC).\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nThis was a longitudinal study using data from MA/WIC (August 2001 to November 2009) to assess the relationship between household FSS during the 12 months preceding the 1-year visit (age 9 to 15 months) and anemia at age 18 months.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTINGS\nInfants included were not anemic at age 12 months and had complete data on household FSS and the following covariates (N=17,831): race/Hispanic ethnicity, maternal education, breastfeeding duration, household size, and child age.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED\nMultiple logistic regression was used to examine the association between household FSS during the prior 12 months and anemia at 18 months, controlling for infant age, sex, and race/Hispanic ethnicity, breastfeeding, maternal education, and household size.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA majority of infants (56%) were nonwhite, and 19.9% lived in food-insecure households (4.8% in very-low food security). Of the infants who were not anemic at age 12 months, 11.7% became anemic by age 18 months. Infants living in low-food-secure households were 42% more likely (adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI, 1.27-1.60) to develop anemia at age 18 months than were their food-secure counterparts. Nonwhite race, higher household size, and lower maternal education were also associated with an elevated risk of anemia at age 18 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLow food security appears to be associated with a significant increased risk of anemia, as do nonwhite ethnicity, lower maternal education, and larger household size. Knowledge of these risk factors can be used to design IDA-prevention interventions in this vulnerable population.",

This review summarises the evidence for the health and nutritional impacts of food subsidy programs among disadvantaged families from high income countries.MethodsRelevant studies reporting dietary intake or health outcomes were identified through systematic searching of electronic databases. Cochrane Public Health Group guidelines informed study selection and interpretation. A narrative synthesis was undertaken due to the limited number of studies and heterogeneity of study design and outcomes.ResultsFourteen studies were included, with most reporting on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children in the USA. Food subsidy program participants, mostly pregnant or postnatal women, were shown to have 10–20% increased intake of targeted foods or nutrients. Evidence for the effectiveness of these programs for men or children was lacking. The main health outcome observed was a small but clinically relevant increase in mean birthweight (23–29g) in the two higher quality WIC studies.ConclusionsLimited high quality evidence of the impacts of food subsidy programs on the health and nutrition of adults and children in high income countries was identified. The improved intake of targeted nutrients and foods, such as fruit and vegetables, could potentially reduce the rate of non-communicable diseases in adults, if the changes in diet are sustained. Associated improvements in perinatal outcomes were limited and most evident in women who smoked during pregnancy. Thus, food subsidy programs for pregnant women and children should aim to focus on improving nutritional status in the longer term. Further prospective studies and economic analyses are needed to confirm the health benefits and justify the investment in food subsidy programs.",

This review presents a new approach to engaging fathers in obesity prevention during the first 1,000 days.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe review focuses on five existing health and social service programs, including prenatal care, pediatric care, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, home visiting, and Early Head Start. For each program, the obesity prevention services provided, evidence of father engagement, and barriers thereto are outlined. Subsequently, policy, systems, and environmental strategies are outlined to address the noted barriers and promote father engagement.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough the programs hold great promise in bringing obesity prevention services to fathers, barriers to their engagement are present in the inner (e.g., limited hours of operation, lack of father-specific materials and programming) and outer (e.g., lack of model programs, best practice models, and consistent funding) settings of programs. Policy, systems, and environmental strategies to increase father engagement focus on earmarked funding, changes to national practice guidelines and practitioner training requirements, and the establishment of father-engagement performance metrics.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreasing father involvement in the specified programs will likely increase their engagement in early obesity prevention in an efficient and sustainable manner.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Fresh Start (WFS) is a randomized controlled trial of nutrition education to promote farmers' market fruit and vegetable (F/V) purchases and consumption among women enrolled in WIC.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nUsing baseline data from WFS to examine associations between social desirability trait, the tendency to respond in a manner consistent with expected norms, and self-reported F/V intake and to determine whether associations, if found, are moderated by participant characteristics.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nSeven hundred forty-four women enrolled in WFS. The setting is a New Jersey-based WIC agency located in a densely populated urban area.\n\n\nMEASURES\nItems assessing participant characteristics, a short form of the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and validated measures of the frequency and quantity of F/V intake.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES\nLinear regression analysis to examine associations between social desirability trait and F/V intake and hierarchical regression analysis to test for moderation by participant characteristics of the associations between social desirability trait and F/V intake.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSocial desirability trait was significantly associated with times per day vegetables were reported to have been consumed (β=0.08, P=0.03). The association was moderated by breastfeeding status. Among breastfeeding women, social desirability trait was unrelated to reported intake, whereas among non-breastfeeding women, it was positively associated with intake (a 1-unit increase in the social desirability score was associated with a 0.12 increase in times per day vegetables were reported to have been consumed).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSocial desirability trait is associated with self-reported vegetable intake among WIC participants generally and non-breastfeeding participants in particular and should be assessed in these groups. Replication studies with comparative measures of \"true intake\" are needed to determine whether social desirability trait biases self-reports of vegetable intake or whether those with a high social desirability trait consume vegetables more often.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to describe gestational weight gain (GWG) trends and identify predictors of GWG among WIC participants in Southern California, 84 % of whom are Hispanic. Using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression, we examined WIC data on 23,840 Hispanic women with full term pregnancies who enrolled in WIC at first trimester and had their last prenatal WIC visit within 1 month or less of their delivery date. Overall, 23.9 % of women exceeded IOM recommendations. Among Hispanic English speakers (HES), 30 % exceeded IOM recommendations compared to 18.7 % of Hispanic Spanish speakers (HSS). Among Hispanic mothers who are less than 20 years of age, 28.9 % exceeded IOM guidelines compared to 19.8 % of Hispanic mothers 35 or older. Among those who started pregnancy overweight or obese, 30.5 % exceeded IOM recommendations versus 12.1 % of those with normal BMI. Multiple logistic regression showed that the odds of exceeding the IOM recommendations were 42 % lower for HSS versus HES, decreased by 2 % for every 1 year increase in age, and increased by 5 % for every one unit increase in BMI at first trimester. Poverty level and health care coverage were also significant predictors of GWG. Given the wide reach and high quality of height/weight measurements taken by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program, WIC administrative data have significant potential to help fill the existing gaps in GWG surveillance, a much needed step for forming policy and designing effective interventions.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nFood insecurity disproportionately affects U.S. demographic groups of children and adult family members at the highest risk for obesity and may lead to weight gain through various pathways. This article reviews research regarding the relationship between food insecurity and weight status, and the potential role of federal food and nutrition assistance programs.\n\n\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION\nA search for relevant peer-reviewed research studies among U.S. children and nonelderly adults, published between 2000 and March 2010, identified 42 studies regarding the relationship between food insecurity and weight status. There were 22 studies regarding the potential role of food and nutrition assistance programs.\n\n\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS\nAmong children and men, support for an association between food insecurity and weight status has been mixed. Women who experience food insecurity are more likely to be overweight or obese compared to women with adequate household resources for food; however, there is little evidence that food insecurity promotes increased weight gain over time. Long-term participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may increase risk for excess weight gain.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdditional research addressing the limitations of current studies is needed to fully understand the observed linkages between food insecurity and risk for obesity. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence these nutritional problems coexist, and it is critical that future efforts to eliminate hunger consider opportunities to promote healthy food choices and physical activity. Evaluations of policy changes and other intervention strategies are needed to determine the potential for food and nutrition assistance programs to more effectively reduce obesity among participants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRacial or ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in adverse birth outcomes are well known, but few studies have examined disparities in the receipt of prenatal health education. The objectives of this study were to examine racial or ethnic and socioeconomic variations in receiving (1) comprehensive prenatal health education and (2) education about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, breastfeeding, alcohol, and smoking cessation from health care practitioners.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were drawn from the 2012 to 2014 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). Twenty-seven states were included with an analysis sample size of 68 025 participants. Receiving counseling on all listed health topics during prenatal care visits was denoted as comprehensive prenatal health education. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of racial or ethnic and socioeconomic variables with receiving comprehensive prenatal health education, and HIV testing, breastfeeding, alcohol, and smoking cessation advice separately.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMultivariable results showed that racial or ethnic minorities and women with a high school degree or less; receiving Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) assistance; and on Medicaid during pregnancy have higher odds of receiving comprehensive prenatal health education (all P  ≤0 .001). Results were similar for receiving HIV testing, breastfeeding, alcohol, and smoking counseling. Low household income was associated with receiving counseling on HIV testing, alcohol, and smoking (all P ≤ 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDespite reporting higher levels of prenatal health education on a variety of health-related topics, disadvantaged women continue to experience disparities in adverse birth outcomes suggesting that education is insufficient in promoting positive behaviors and birth outcomes.",

This study presents the evaluation results from one such HCSI. Fresh Foods Here evaluated its network of eight stores in Columbus, Ohio between November 2013 and August 2014. Data from invoices, inventories, rapid market assessments, and customers surveys were analyzed for evidence of impact on the service delivery and personal domains of food access. For some indicators, initial gains were concentrated between pre- and interim evaluation periods, followed by either a leveling off or decline between interim and post. However, overall results were promising, with increases noted in the number of healthy items ordered by store owners, in daily foot traffic and transactions, and in consumer confidence for certain healthy behaviors. Lessons learned concerning the operation and evaluation of HCSIs are shared.",

        "abstract": "The national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program (SNAP) has been successful in reducing food insecurity among low-income Americans. However, the program has also been criticized as unhealthy food choices, and rates of diet-related chronic diseases remain high among SNAP beneficiaries. Recently, several multi-component interventions have targeted SNAP beneficiaries, aiming to improve how benefits are utilized to support a healthful diet. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the breadth of published interventions that have targeted SNAP beneficiaries, and their reported impact on diet and nutrition related outcomes. Using key search terms, a literature search of government and peer review databases was conducted. Twelve unique interventions were identified and categorized based on the type of intervention delivered: 1) monetary incentives 2) nutrition education, and 3) combined nutrition education plus monetary incentives. Across all interventions, monetary interventions showed modest improvements in reported fruit and vegetable intake among SNAP beneficiaries. While nutrition education interventions showed improvement in psychosocial correlates of diet, changes in dietary intake were inconsistent. Combination programs demonstrated the strongest improvements in dietary change among beneficiaries. Variability in types of outcomes measured limits comparability of findings across studies, and our findings calls for further evaluation in this area. This scoping review suggests using financial incentives combined with nutrition education may be effective in improving dietary intake among SNAP beneficiaries. Future research should integrate more robust study designs and consider multiple levels of intervention to effectively change beneficiary habits and in turn, reduce diet related disease in this population.",

For mothers (n = 21,863) and their children (n = 57,377) participating in WIC (2001–2006), longitudinal measures of household food security status were collected using a subscale of the USDA Food Security Module. Using logistic regression, household food security status at the last WIC visit was associated with measures of WIC duration (number of trimesters on WIC for pregnant women, and number of WIC visits for children). Among women with prenatal household food insecurity with hunger, odds of any post-partum household food insecurity was reduced with first (AOR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.48–0.94) or second trimester of entry (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.45–0.90) versus third. Among children with initial household food insecurity without hunger, an additional WIC visit reduced the odds of any household food insecurity (AOR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.90–0.94) and of household food insecurity with hunger (AOR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89–0.98) at the last visit. Among those with initial household food insecurity with hunger, an additional WIC visit reduced the odds of any household food insecurity (AOR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.92–0.99) and of household food insecurity with hunger (AOR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.83–0.94) at the last visit. Earlier and longer WIC participation may improve household food security status, particularly of vulnerable groups.",

        "abstract": "Because children disproportionately live in poverty, they are especially vulnerable during economic crises, making the social safety net a key buffer against the effects of economic disadvantage on their development. The Great Recession of 2007-2009 had strong and lasting effects on American children and families, including striking negative effects on their health environments. Understanding access to the health safety net during this time of increased economic need, as well as the extent to which all children-regardless of age, income or race/ethnicity-share in the increased use of transfer programs, is therefore important in identifying the availability and accessibility of government assistance for those in need. Focusing on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program because of its strong effects on child development, we use longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to examine change and stability in children's WIC enrollment before, during and after the recession. Specifically, we examine: 1) whether children's WIC enrollment increased alongside changing family income, and 2) the extent to which changes in participation were shared by all subpopulations, regardless of age, income, and race/ethnicity. Analyses reveal that WIC participation among eligible children increased leading up to, during, and after the Great Recession, suggesting that the program was responsive to increasing economic need. Examining the distribution of WIC enrollment across demographic groups largely reveals a pattern of stable inequality in access and \"take up.\" Children born to poorer and less-educated mothers were more likely to be enrolled prior to the recession, and these differences remain mostly constant during and after the recession. Eligible Hispanic children had consistently higher enrollment, particularly among those in families with foreign-born mothers. The findings suggest that not all eligible children equally enroll in WIC, but that these differences have not been drastically exacerbated by macroeconomic instability.",

        "abstract": "Sixteen million US children (21%) live in households without consistent access to adequate food. After multiple risk factors are considered, children who live in households that are food insecure, even at the lowest levels, are likely to be sick more often, recover from illness more slowly, and be hospitalized more frequently. Lack of adequate healthy food can impair a child's ability to concentrate and perform well in school and is linked to higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems from preschool through adolescence. Food insecurity can affect children in any community, not only traditionally underserved ones. Pediatricians can play a central role in screening and identifying children at risk for food insecurity and in connecting families with needed community resources. Pediatricians should also advocate for federal and local policies that support access to adequate healthy food for an active and healthy life for all children and their families.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo describe a clinical approach for food insecurity screening incorporating a menu offering food-assistance referrals, and to examine relationships between food insecurity and referral selection.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCaregivers of 3- to 10-year-old children presenting for well-child care completed a self-administered questionnaire on a laptop computer. Items included the US Household Food Security Survey Module: 6-Item Short Form (food insecurity screen) and a referral menu offering assistance with: 1) finding a food pantry, 2) getting hot meals, 3) applying for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and 4) applying for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Referrals were offered independent of food insecurity status or eligibility. We examined associations between food insecurity and referral selection using multiple logistic regression while adjusting for covariates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 340 caregivers participated; 106 (31.2%) reported food insecurity, and 107 (31.5%) selected one or more referrals. Forty-nine caregivers (14.4%) reported food insecurity but selected no referrals; 50 caregivers (14.7%) selected one or more referrals but did not report food insecurity; and 57 caregivers (16.8%) both reported food insecurity and selected one or more referrals. After adjustment, caregivers who selected one or more referrals had greater odds of food insecurity compared to caregivers who selected no referrals (adjusted odds ratio 4.0; 95% confidence interval 2.4-7.0).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this sample, there was incomplete overlap between food insecurity and referral selection. Offering referrals may be a helpful adjunct to standard screening for eliciting family preferences and identifying unmet social needs.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) variables predict soy milk intake in a sample of WIC participants in 2 Illinois counties (n = 380). A cross-sectional survey was used, which examined soy foods intake, behavioral beliefs, subjective norms, motivation, and intention. Soy product intake was low at both sites, and many participants (40%) did not know that soy milk was WIC approved. Most (> 70%) wanted to comply with their health care providers, but didn't know their opinions about soy milk (50-66%). Intention was significantly correlated with intake (0.507, P ≤ 0.01; 0.308, P ≤ 0.05). Environmental beliefs (0.282 and 0.410, P ≤ 0.01) and expectancy beliefs (0.490 and 0.636, P ≤ 0.01) were correlated with intention. At site 1, 30% of the variance in intention to consume soy milk was explained by expectancy beliefs and subjective norm beliefs (P < 0.0001); at site 2, 40% of the variance in intention was explained by expectancy beliefs. The TPB variables of expectancy beliefs predicted intention to consume soy milk in WIC participants. Therefore, knowing more about the health benefits of soy and how to cook with soy milk would increase WIC participants' intention to consume soy milk. Positive messages about soy milk from health care providers could influence intake.",

        "abstract": "With the global financial meltdown, the crisis of poverty has deepened in communities across the United States. This essay reports results from a culture-centered project on fostering spaces for listening to the voices of the poor in CrossRoads County, Indiana. It highlights the intersections of health and poverty as they emerge from the narratives of mothers utilizing the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Depression, humiliation, and inaccessibility to health care and healthy living outline the struggles of women as they negotiate their access to health. The articulations of agency are situated around competing cultural narratives that, on the one hand, draw on the threads of individual responsibility which resonate through mainstream discourses of poverty in the United States and, on the other hand, interrogate the structural erasure of the basic capacities of health.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of an innovative breastfeeding promotion video intervention in addressing barriers to breastfeeding among low-income women in the state of Mississippi. The 15-minute video features a diverse group of women and their families. Survey data were collected from Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children clients in the intervention group (n = 310) before and after watching the video, and from a comparison group (n = 204) that did not watch the video. The 2 groups were comparable at baseline. The intervention significantly improved women's perceptions with regard to the “embarrassment” and “time and social constraints” barriers to breastfeeding. In terms of the “lack of social support” barrier, the video positively affected participants' feelings that the baby's father encouraged breastfeeding but did not change their perceptions of support from female relatives and friends. The authors conclude that the video is an effective method of breastfeeding promotion among low-income women.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of ReviewSuboptimal diet is a leading cause of cardiometabolic disease and economic burdens. Evidence-based dietary policies within 5 domains—food prices, reformulation, marketing, labeling, and government food assistance programs—appear promising at improving cardiometabolic health. Yet, the extent of new dietary policy adoption in the US and key elements crucial to define in designing such policies are not well established. We created an inventory of recent US dietary policy cases aiming to improve cardiometabolic health and assessed the extent of their proposal and adoption at federal, state, local, and tribal levels; and categorized and characterized the key elements in their policy design.Recent FindingsRecent federal dietary policies adopted to improve cardiometabolic health include reformulation (trans-fat elimination), marketing (mass-media campaigns to increase fruits and vegetables), labeling (Nutrition Facts Panel updates, menu calorie labeling), and food assistance programs (financial incentives for fruits and vegetables in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program). Federal voluntary guidelines have been proposed for sodium reformulation and food marketing to children. Recent state proposals included sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes, marketing restrictions, and SNAP restrictions, but few were enacted. Local efforts varied significantly, with certain localities consistently leading in the proposal or adoption of relevant policies. Across all jurisdictions, most commonly selected dietary targets included fruits and vegetables, SSBs, trans-fat, added sugar, sodium, and calories; other healthy (e.g., nuts) or unhealthy (e.g., processed meats) factors were largely not addressed. Key policy elements to define in designing these policies included those common across domains (e.g., level of government, target population, dietary target, dietary definition, implementation mechanism), and domain-specific (e.g., media channels for food marketing domain) or policy-specific (e.g., earmarking for taxes) elements. Characteristics of certain elements were similarly defined (e.g., fruit and vegetable definition, warning language used in SSB warning labels), while others varied across cases within a policy (e.g., tax base for SSB taxes). Several key elements were not always sufficiently characterized in government documents, and dietary target selections and definitions did not consistently align with the evidence-base.SummaryThese findings highlight recent action on dietary policies to improve cardiometabolic health in the US; and key elements necessary to design such policies.",

        "abstract": "Breastfeeding rates among mothers in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) are lower than for other mothers in the United States. The objective of this study was to test the acceptability and feasibility of the Lactation Advice thru Texting Can Help intervention. Mothers were enrolled at 18-30 weeks gestation from two WIC breastfeeding peer counselling (PC) programmes if they intended to breastfeed and had unlimited text messaging, more than fifth-grade literacy level, and fluency in English or Spanish. Participants were randomized to the control arm (PC support without texting) or the intervention arm (PC support with texting). The two-way texting intervention provided breastfeeding education and support from peer counsellors. Primary outcomes included early post-partum (PP) contact and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates at 2 weeks PP. Feasibility outcomes included text messaging engagement and mother's satisfaction with texting platform. Fifty-eight women were enrolled, 52 of whom were available for intention-to-treat analysis (n = 30 texting, n = 22 control). Contact between mothers and PCs within 48 hr of delivery was greater in the texting group (86.6% vs. 27.3%, p < .001). EBF rates at 2 weeks PP among participants in the texting intervention was 50% versus 31.8% in the control arm (p = .197). Intervention group mothers tended to be more likely to meet their breastfeeding goals (p = .06). Participants were highly satisfied with the Lactation Advice thru Texting Can Help intervention, and findings suggest that it may improve early post-delivery contact and increase EBF rates among mothers enrolled in WIC who receive PC. A large, multicentre trial is feasible and warranted.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the association between amount (below or above recommendations), preparation (liquid vs. powder), and type (regular vs. hydrolysate) of infant formula consumed and weight in infants participating in the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Program in Hawaii (HI) and Puerto Rico (PR). This was a secondary analysis of 162 caregivers with healthy term 0⁻2-month-old infants. Socio-demographics, infant food frequency questionnaires, and weight and length were assessed at baseline and after four months. Infant feeding practices were associated with weight-for-length z-scores using multivariable logistic regression. In total, 37.7% were exclusively breastfed and 27.2% were exclusively formula-fed. Among formula users, regular (63.6%) and powder (87.0%) formula were the most common; 43.2% consumed formula above recommendations. Most infants had rapid weight gain (61.1%). Infants fed regular formula had higher odds of overweight after four months (adjusted OR = 8.77, 95% CI: 1.81⁻42.6) and higher odds of rapid weight gain (adjusted OR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.12, 8.61). Those exclusively formula fed had higher odds of slow weight gain (adjusted OR = 4.07, 95% CI: 1.17⁻14.2). Formula preparation and amount of formula were not associated with weight. These results could inform the WIC program's nutrition education messages on infant feeding. Studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results.",

        "abstract": "Policy Points High-profile international evidence reviews by the World Health Organization, the World Cancer Research Fund, the American Institute for Cancer Research, and the American Cancer Society concluded that processed meat consumption increases the risk of cancer. The red meat and processed meat industries are influential in the United States and in several other nations. The US federal government supports public-private partnerships for commodity meat promotion and advertising. Four potential policy options to affect consumption of processed meat are taxation, reduced processed meat quantities in school meal standards, public service announcements, and warning labels. Feasibility of these options would be enhanced by an explicit and science-based statement on processed meat in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n\n\nCONTEXT\nThe World Health Organization, the World Cancer Research Fund, and the American Cancer Society have each in recent years concluded that processed meats are probable carcinogens. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans did not separately evaluate health effects of processed meat, although it mentioned lower processed meat intakes among characteristics of healthy diets.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe summarized the international scientific literature on meat intake and cancer risk; described the scientific and political processes behind the periodic Dietary Guidelines for Americans; described the US red meat and processed meat industries and the economic structure of government-supported industry initiatives for advertising and promotion; and reviewed and analyzed specific factors and precedents that influence the feasibility of four potential policy approaches to reduce processed meat intake.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nBased on a review of 800 epidemiological studies, the World Health Organization found sufficient evidence in humans that processed meat is carcinogenic, estimating that each 50-gram increase in daily intake increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18%. Among the four policy responses we studied, legal feasibility is highest in the US for three policy options: reducing processed meat in school meals and other specific government-sponsored nutrition programs; a local, state, or federal tax on processed meat; and public service announcements on health harms of processed meats by either the government or private sector entities. Legal feasibility is moderate for a fourth policy option, mandatory warning labels, due to outstanding legal questions about the minimum evidence required to support this policy. Political feasibility is influenced by the economic and political power of the meat industries and also depends on decisions in the next round of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans about how to assess and describe the link between processed meat consumption and cancer risk.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPublic policy initiatives to reduce processed meat intake have a strong scientific and public health justification and are legally feasible, but political feasibility is influenced by the economic and political power of meat industries and also by uncertainty about the likely treatment of processed meat in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.",

Design Descriptive study; data included a stratified clustered random sample of SNAP participants and stakeholder interviews. Setting Washington State. Participants A total of 400 SNAP participants and 51 SNAP‐Ed stakeholders. Main Outcome Measures The SNAP participants’ reported barriers to accessing FMs and the SNAP‐Ed stakeholders’ perceptions of FM access barriers. Analysis Thematic content analysis, descriptive statistics, 2‐sample tests of proportion, and Pearson chi‐square tests (P < .025). Results A majority of SNAP participants reported they did not shop at an FM because it is inconvenient (n = 193; 51%) and not financially viable (n = 84; 22%). Moreover, 9% of SNAP participants (n = 34) stated that they experienced no barriers. The SNAP‐Ed stakeholders placed increased emphasis on transportation and cost barriers compared with the SNAP participants. Conclusions and Implications Comprehensive, multilevel strategies that reflect the perspectives of SNAP participants could increase SNAP use at FMs. Opening FMs in diverse locations at variable operating times may address convenience barriers while engaging the targeted populations’ communities to promote FMs, and FM incentive programs may address financial and awareness barriers.",

The relationship of knowledge and confidence with frequent dental referrals was tested using logistic regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRegression results found that confidence in performing oral health risk assessments (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.13, 3.96), confidence in making dental referrals (OR = 3.02; 95% CI = 1.45-6.29), and confidence in expected outcomes that parents would seek dental care when advised to do so (OR = 3.11; 95% CI = 1.62, 5.97) were associated with more frequent dental referrals.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe more confident WIC nutritionists feel about oral health, the more likely they are to make dental referrals. Screening and referral by WIC workers may benefit children by improving access to dental care, as the WIC clinic is frequently the first point of contact with a health professional.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOver consumption of energy-dense nutrient-poor foods may contribute to childhood obesity. We hypothesized that greater than recommended servings of sugar sweetened beverages and foods, indicators of food security, and a high maternal recumbent weight-for-length are positively associated with high percentages of child overweight/obesity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis secondary data analysis consisted of a sample of 240 mother-child dyads. The original studies were designed to examine the effect of a public health nursing intervention on optimal childhood growth for low-income, minority children. Eligibility to participate included: 1) mothers self-identified as Hispanic; 2) children were 12-24 months old; and 3) children were enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC); and 4) children were free of any major disease. Multivariate logistic regression examined the association between child weight, weight-for-length, maternal recumbent weight-for-length, child's eating schedule, maternal attitudes on feeding, food security, and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts and fatty meats.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReceiving SNAP was positively associated with child weight-for-length (WL). Children whose mothers reported ever having received SNAP were 2.01 times more likely to be overweight compared to children whose mothers did not report ever having received SNAP (95% CI=1.04-3.90). Children who consumed desserts were 2.87 times more likely to be overweight compared to children who did not consume desserts (95% CI=1.19-6.88). Also, child's caloric intake was significantly associated with child WL. Children who consumed more calories were 1.00 times more likely to be overweight compared to children who consumed fewer calories (95% CI=1.00-1.00).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nResearch on food security and children's weight has reported mixed findings. Methodological issues have been identified as contributory to the inconsistent findings. Of paramount importance to these studies is the measurement of low food security.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nChildren in this sample who were food insecure, as indicated by SNAP recipients, were more likely to have a higher WL measurement. Future studies should focus on the correlation between food security and hunger/satiety cues.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that children ages 2 to 11 years should achieve optimal physical and cognitive development, maintain healthy weights, enjoy food, and reduce the risk of chronic disease through appropriate eating habits and participation in regular physical activity. Rapid increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity during the 1980s and 1990s focused attention on young children's overconsumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages and lack of physical activity. While recent data suggest a stabilization of obesity rates, several public health concerns remain. These include the most effective ways to promote healthy weights, the number of children living in food insecurity, the under-consumption of key nutrients, and the early development of diet-related risks for chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, and osteoporosis. This Position Paper reviews what children 2 to 11 years old in the United States are reportedly eating, explores trends in food and nutrient intakes, and examines the impact of federal nutrition programs on child nutrition. Current dietary recommendations and guidelines for physical activity are also discussed. The roles of parents and caregivers in influencing the development of life-long healthy eating behaviors are highlighted. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics works with other allied health and food industry professionals to translate dietary recommendations and guidelines into positive, practical health messages. Specific recommendations and sources of science-based nutrition messages to improve the nutritional well-being of children are provided for food and nutrition practitioners.",

        "abstract": "Since 1975, the US Department of Agriculture has sponsored the Summer Food Service Program as a nationwide strategy for providing nutritious meals to children and youth (aged 18 years or younger) in low-income communities during the summer months. Many programs are sponsored by community organizations as well as school districts that may offer the program through the Summer Food Service Program or a seamless waiver, allowing them to extend school meals programs into the summer. These summer nutrition programs are designed to decrease food insecurity and improve health outcomes among at-risk populations. However, the characteristics of these programs, including the types of participants reached, and the programs' influence on outcomes such as academics, behavior, and physical and mental health, have not been summarized. The aims of this narrative review are to present existing knowledge about the characteristics of summer nutrition programs and their influence on students, to identify knowledge gaps, and to identify future research needs. An extensive search identified eight peer-reviewed articles and 10 reports, briefs, or other documents reporting research on the Summer Food Service Program. A variety of additional literature was reviewed to provide relevant information about summer nutrition programs. The review revealed a dearth of research regarding current Summer Food Service Program implementation. Summer nutrition programs alleviated food insecurity among at-risk populations; however, little research was found about the influence of summer programs on students' dietary intake or weight outcomes. More rigorous and mixed-methods studies examining the characteristics and influence of summer nutrition programs are needed.",

        "abstract": "The Healthy People 2010objective to increase US national breastfeeding rates uses data from the Ross Laboratories Mothers Survey for monitoring. Because of scientific and political problems related to the use of these data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently held a meeting on surveillance systems for monitoring breastfeeding behaviors in the United States. Participants identified and discussed 12 surveillance systems that collect or could collect breastfeeding data. None of the existing systems met the participants' definition of an ideal system, although each was seen as providing additional insight into breastfeeding behaviors. Key recommendations are to (1) justify the need for additional resources to build a comprehensive national system; (2) add questions on breastfeeding incidence, duration, and exclusivity to the National Immunization Survey; (3) ensure that breastfeeding questions on national surveys are consistent; and (4) encourage state use of the breastfeeding module of the CDC's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) that schools and communities have a shared responsibility to provide students with access to high-quality, affordable, nutritious foods and beverages. School-based nutrition services, including the provision of meals through the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program, are an integral part of the total education program. Strong wellness policies promote environments that enhance nutrition integrity and help students to develop lifelong healthy behaviors. ADA actively supported the 2004 and proposed 2010 Child Nutrition reauthorization which determines school nutrition policy. ADA believes that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans should serve as the foundation for all food and nutrition assistance programs and should apply to all foods and beverages sold or served to students during the school day. Local wellness policies are mandated by federal legislation for all school districts participating in the National School Lunch Program. These policies support nutrition integrity,including a healthy school environment. Nutrition integrity also requires coordinating nutrition education and promotion and funding research on program outcomes. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, and other credentialed staff, are essential for nutrition integrity in schools to perform in policy-making, management, education, and community building roles. A healthy school environment can be achieved through adequate funding of school meals programs and through implementation and evaluation of strong local wellness policies.",

        "abstract": "Improving maternal and child health is a key objective of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals and the Healthy People goals for improving the health of Americans. Government initiatives are important particularly for reducing disparities that affect disadvantaged populations. Head Start, Healthy Start, WIC and Medicaid are four federal programs that target disparities in maternal and child health outcomes. This paper reviews recent evaluations of these programs to identify outcomes assessed and opportunities for further evaluation of these programs. We conducted a review of recent evaluation studies assessing the impact of four maternal and child health programs on a health or healthcare outcome. Sources for published literature included the PubMed, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases. Titles and abstracts of studies were examined to determine if they met inclusion criteria. Included studies were categorized by type of outcome examined. Twenty peer-reviewed studies published between January 2006 and June 2011 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies examined infant outcomes (11), followed by breastfeeding/nutrition (4), maternal health (3), and unintended pregnancy (2). Measures used were consistent across studies; however, findings on the impact of programs were mixed reflecting differences in selection of comparison group, data source and statistical methods. The impact of maternal and child health programs may vary by setting and population served, but inconclusive findings remain. Health service researchers can build upon current evaluations to increase our understanding of what works, help target resources, and improve evaluation of programs in the future.",

The objective of this study was to examine the longitudinal association between neighbourhood food environment and adiposity among low-income preschool-aged children in a major metropolitan region in the USA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study sample was 32 172 low-income preschool-aged children in Los Angeles County who had repeated weight and height measurements collected between ages 2 and 5 years through a federal nutrition assistance programme. We conducted multilevel longitudinal analyses to examine how spatial densities of healthy and unhealthy retail food outlets in the children's neighbourhoods were related to adiposity, as measured by weight-for-height z-score (WHZ), while controlling for neighbourhood-level income and education, family income, maternal education, and child's gender and race/ethnicity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDensity of healthy food outlets was associated with mean WHZ at age 3 in a non-linear fashion, with mean WHZ being lowest for those exposed to approximately 0.7 healthy food outlets per square mile and higher for lesser and greater densities. Density of unhealthy food outlets was not associated with child WHZ.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found a non-linear relationship between WHZ and density of healthy food outlets. Research aiming to understand the sociobehavioural mechanisms by which the retail food environment influences early childhood obesity development is complex and must consider contextual settings.",

        "abstract": "Improving maternal and child health is a key objective of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals and the Healthy People goals for improving the health of Americans. Government initiatives are important particularly for reducing disparities that affect disadvantaged populations. Head Start, Healthy Start, WIC and Medicaid are four federal programs that target disparities in maternal and child health outcomes. This paper reviews recent evaluations of these programs to identify outcomes assessed and opportunities for further evaluation of these programs. We conducted a review of recent evaluation studies assessing the impact of four maternal and child health programs on a health or healthcare outcome. Sources for published literature included the PubMed, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases. Titles and abstracts of studies were examined to determine if they met inclusion criteria. Included studies were categorized by type of outcome examined. Twenty peer-reviewed studies published between January 2006 and June 2011 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies examined infant outcomes (11), followed by breastfeeding/nutrition (4), maternal health (3), and unintended pregnancy (2). Measures used were consistent across studies; however, findings on the impact of programs were mixed reflecting differences in selection of comparison group, data source and statistical methods. The impact of maternal and child health programs may vary by setting and population served, but inconclusive findings remain. Health service researchers can build upon current evaluations to increase our understanding of what works, help target resources, and improve evaluation of programs in the future.",

We conducted multilevel longitudinal analyses to examine how spatial densities of healthy and unhealthy retail food outlets in the children's neighbourhoods were related to adiposity, as measured by weight-for-height z-score (WHZ), while controlling for neighbourhood-level income and education, family income, maternal education, and child's gender and race/ethnicity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDensity of healthy food outlets was associated with mean WHZ at age 3 in a non-linear fashion, with mean WHZ being lowest for those exposed to approximately 0.7 healthy food outlets per square mile and higher for lesser and greater densities. Density of unhealthy food outlets was not associated with child WHZ.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found a non-linear relationship between WHZ and density of healthy food outlets. Research aiming to understand the sociobehavioural mechanisms by which the retail food environment influences early childhood obesity development is complex and must consider contextual settings.",

        "abstract": "Consuming a balanced diet, such as the food groups represented on MyPlate, is key to improving health disparities. Despite the best of intentions, however, the dietary guidelines can be culturally challenging, particularly when it comes to dairy consumption. Many African and Hispanic Americans avoid milk and dairy products-key contributors of three shortfall nutrients (calcium, potassium and vitamin D)-because many people in these populations believe they are lactose intolerant. However, avoiding dairy can have significant health effects. An emerging body of evidence suggests that yogurt and other dairy products may help support reduced risk of heart disease, hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes-conditions that disproportionately impact people of color. For this reason, the National Medical Association and the National Hispanic Medical Association issued a joint consensus statement recommending African Americans consume three to four servings of low-fat dairy every day. Cultured dairy products could play an important role in addressing these recommendations. Because of the presence of lactase-producing cultures, yogurt is often a more easily digestible alternative to milk, and thus more palatable to people who experience symptoms of lactose intolerance. This was a key factor cited in the final rule to include yogurt in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE\nIn the United States rates of exclusive breastfeeding duration remain exceedingly low. Exclusive breastfeeding is a complex learned behavior that is influenced by social cognitive, interpersonal, and structural factors. Interventions are needed that address factors at multiple levels of the social-ecological model. This study was designed to examine the social cognitive predictors of exclusive breastfeeding behavior in a sample of low-income women attending the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) breastfeeding peer counseling program and enrolled in the Lactation Advice Through Texting Can Help (LATCH) study.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objectives were to examine whether: (1) the theoretical model, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), fit the data well; (2) planning mediated the effect of intentions and maintenance self-efficacy on exclusive breastfeeding; and (3) recovery self-efficacy mediated the association between maintenance self-efficacy and exclusive breastfeeding behavior.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOutcome expectancies, action self-efficacy and intentions were assessed prenatally at baseline in N = 119 participants. Maintenance self-efficacy, planning, recovery self-efficacy and breastfeeding behavior were measured at two weeks post partum. Structural equation modeling with mean and variance adjusted Weighted Least Squares estimation was used to examine the applicability of the HAPA model to the data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPhase specific self-efficacy and planning significantly predicted exclusive breastfeeding status. Planning and recovery self-efficacy mediated the association between maintenance self-efficacy and exclusive breastfeeding. Planning did not emerge as a mediator between intentions and behavior.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results demonstrate the utility of the HAPA model in predicting exclusive breastfeeding behavior among low-income women attending WIC. LATCH is a theoretically sound text messaging intervention that can be used to augment and reinforce the WIC breastfeeding peer counseling process.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis article describes the background and design of the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study (SNDA-III).\n\n\nDESIGN\nSNDA-III is a nationally representative cross-sectional study of the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program in 2005. The three-stage sample design allowed description of district and school food environments and policies, analysis of foods and nutrients in school lunches and breakfasts, and assessment of the role of school meals and competitive foods in students' diets. Surveys of district and school staff were by telephone or in person; school menu data were collected in a mail survey with telephone assistance; and student and parent interviews were conducted in person and in school, except that parents of secondary-school students were interviewed by telephone. Student interviews included a 24-hour dietary recall, as well as measurement of height and weight. Response rates were 83% for districts, 95% for schools, and 63% for students, whose participation was constrained by consent issues and school schedules.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/SETTING\nData were collected from 130 public school food authorities (districts that offer federally subsidized school meals), 398 schools within those districts, and 2,314 public-school students in grades 1 through 12 in these schools. Of the 2,314 students, a random subset of 666 (29%) completed a second recall to permit estimation of usual nutrient intake distributions.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED\nDescriptive tabulations were used to summarize the background characteristics of schools and students and most study outcomes. Multivariate regression models and propensity score matching were used to compare the nutrient intakes of school meal participants and nonparticipants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSNDA-III data provide a rich resource for examining interactions among the school meal programs, the school food environment, students' diets, and child obesity. Subsequent articles in this Supplement present analyses in all these areas.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the nutritional quality of food packages offered in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) using the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010).\n\n\nDESIGN\nData were collected from the list of the food products provided by the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Handbook 501 for FDPIR. Nutritional quality was measured through a cross-sectional analysis of five randomly selected food packages offered through FDPIR. HEI-2010 component and total scores were calculated for each food package. ANOVA and t tests assessed significant differences between food packages and HEI-2010 maximum scores, respectively.\n\n\nSETTING\nThis study took place in the USA.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nStudy units included food products offered through FDPIR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean total HEI-2010 score for the combined FDPIR food packages was significantly lower than the total HEI-2010 maximum score of 100 (66·38 (sd 11·60); P<0·01). Mean scores for total fruit (3·52 (sd 0·73); P<0·05), total vegetables (2·58 (sd 0·15); P<0·001), greens and beans (0·92 (sd 1·00); P<0·001), dairy (5·12 (sd 0·63); P<0·001), total protein foods (4·14 (sd 0·56); P<0·05) and refined grains (3·04 (sd 2·90); P<0·001) were all significantly lower than the maximum values.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe FDPIR food package HEI-2010 score was notably higher than other federal food assistance and nutrition programmes. Study findings highlight opportunities for the FDPIR to modify its offerings to best support lifestyles towards prevention of diet-related chronic disease.",

        "abstract": "Declining health and food security status among low-income immigrants in the U.S. may result from limited access to healthful, cultural foods and safety net programs. We held focus group discussions with low-income Cambodian and Brazilian immigrants (11 groups, n = 84) living in Massachusetts. Cambodians and Brazilians valued healthful, cultural foods, emphasizing their beliefs that cultural foods are healthier and beneficial for weight management and aging. Although both groups could access these foods, some individuals had difficulty affording them. Cambodians reported that food quality decreased over the month due to inadequate resources. Cambodians relied on SNAP, WIC, families, and food pantries; however, Brazilians generally did not participate in safety net programs. Barriers to accessing and using safety nets appear to limit diet quality for some immigrant families. Targeted nutrition interventions should build on current knowledge of and desire for healthful, cultural foods in the context of available safety nets.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the cost of infant formula, explore mothers' perceptions of formula cost, and assess whether cost influences the decision to breastfeed.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA mixed-methodological descriptive study with survey (phase 1) and interviews (phase 2) was completed in Rhode Island Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) offices. Thirty non-breastfeeding mothers participated in phase 1 and 14 pregnant women participated in phase 2. Means and frequencies were calculated for phase 1. For phase 2, data were organized into matrices and thematic analysis identified key themes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNon-breastfeeding mothers were spending an extra $46 a month on average in their child's fourth month on formula beyond the formula supplied by WIC. This was perceived as high, but formula cost did not influence their decision to breastfeed. For mothers intending to breastfeed, cost information was perceived as an additional motivation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nInformation on supplemental formula cost could be provided as a motivator for women intending to breastfeed. Future research should investigate how cost information could be used to support breastfeeding initiation and duration among WIC mothers.",

        "abstract": "Improving maternal and child health is a key objective of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals and the Healthy People goals for improving the health of Americans. Government initiatives are important particularly for reducing disparities that affect disadvantaged populations. Head Start, Healthy Start, WIC and Medicaid are four federal programs that target disparities in maternal and child health outcomes. This paper reviews recent evaluations of these programs to identify outcomes assessed and opportunities for further evaluation of these programs. We conducted a review of recent evaluation studies assessing the impact of four maternal and child health programs on a health or healthcare outcome. Sources for published literature included the PubMed, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases. Titles and abstracts of studies were examined to determine if they met inclusion criteria. Included studies were categorized by type of outcome examined. Twenty peer-reviewed studies published between January 2006 and June 2011 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies examined infant outcomes (11), followed by breastfeeding/nutrition (4), maternal health (3), and unintended pregnancy (2). Measures used were consistent across studies; however, findings on the impact of programs were mixed reflecting differences in selection of comparison group, data source and statistical methods. The impact of maternal and child health programs may vary by setting and population served, but inconclusive findings remain. Health service researchers can build upon current evaluations to increase our understanding of what works, help target resources, and improve evaluation of programs in the future.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity is associated with many poor health outcomes yet is not routinely addressed in clinical settings. The purpose of this study was to implement a food insecurity screening and referral program in Student-run Free Clinics (SRFC) and to document the prevalence of food insecurity screening in this low-income patient population. All patients seen in three SRFC sites affiliated with one institution in San Diego, California were screened for food insecurity using the 6-item United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Security Survey between January and July 2015 and referred to appropriate resources. The percentage of patients who were food insecure was calculated. The screening rate was 92.5% (430/463 patients), 74.0% (318/430) were food insecure, including 30.7% (132/430) with very low food security. A food insecurity registry and referral tracking system revealed that by January 2016, 201 participants were receiving monthly boxes of food onsite, 66 used an off-site food pantry, and 64 were enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). It is possible to implement a food insecurity screening and referral program into SRFCs. The prevalence of food insecurity in this population was remarkably high yet remained largely unknown until this program was implemented. Other health care settings, particularly those with underserved patient populations, should consider implementing food insecurity screening and referral programs.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To describe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program–Education (SNAP‐Ed)‐supported farmers' market (FM) access activities in Washington State communities and identify associations between participation in these activities and SNAP participants' FM shopping and fruit and vegetable consumption. Design: Descriptive study; data included stakeholder interviews and surveys with FM managers and a stratified clustered random sample of SNAP participants. Setting: Washington State. Participants: A total of 51 SNAP‐Ed stakeholders, 400 SNAP participants, and 94 FM managers participated. Main Outcome Measure(s): Partnership measures and SNAP‐Ed FM access activities; SNAP participants' participation in FM access activities, FM shopping frequency, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Analysis: Thematic content analysis, descriptive statistics, and 0‐inflated Poisson and ordinary least‐squares regression models. Results: A total of 343 FM access activities and strong multi‐sector partnerships were identified. Fifty percent of SNAP participants shopped at an FM in the past year, and 30% at least monthly. The SNAP participants participating in FM access activities shopped at FMs more frequently (P = .005). The SNAP participants shopping at FMs ate fruit and vegetables more frequently than did non‐FM shoppers (P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Through nutrition education and systems and environmental changes, Washington SNAP‐Ed developed effective programming and multi‐sector partnerships. These efforts are associated with SNAP participants' FM shopping and fruit and vegetable consumption.",

Our study used the Total Worker Health Framework to characterize workplace factors acting as barriers and/or contributors to breastfeeding among women participating in the New Hampshire WIC. Surveys were collected from WIC mothers (n = 682), which asked about employment, industry, and workplace accommodation and supports related to breastfeeding in the workplace. We found workplace policy factors supporting breastfeeding (i.e., having paid maternity leave, other maternity leave, and a breastfeeding policy) varied by industry. Women in specific service-oriented industries (i.e., accommodation and retail) reported the lowest rates of breastfeeding initiation and workplace supports for breastfeeding and pumping. Further, how a woman hoped to feed and having a private pumping space at work were significantly associated with industry, breastfeeding initiation, and breastfeeding duration. A substantial portion of women reported being not sure about their workplace environment, policies, and culture related to breastfeeding. Additional studies with larger sample sizes of women participating in WIC are needed to further characterize the barriers to breastfeeding associated with specific industries.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nOur goal was to test the hypothesis that increased fruit juice intake and parental restriction of children's eating are associated with increased adiposity gain and whether exposure to nutritional counseling predicted reduced adiposity gain among children.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nA sample of parents or guardians of children aged 1 to 4 years who attended 1 of 49 Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children agencies in New York State were surveyed in 1999 or 2000 (N = 2801). The survey addressed children's dietary intake, parental feeding practices, and parental exposure to nutritional counseling messages to increase fruit, vegetable, and low-fat milk intakes. Each child's height and weight were measured approximately every 6 months for up to 48 months. A prospective cohort design was used in which survey variables were the predictors and the outcome was change in children's adiposity, defined as change in age- and gender-standardized BMI per month (ie, BMI z-score slope).\n\n\nRESULTS\nControlling for gender and ethnicity, the relationship between juice intake and adiposity gain depended on children's initial overweight status. Among children who were initially either at risk for overweight or overweight, increased fruit juice intake was associated with excess adiposity gain, whereas parental offerings of whole fruits were associated with reduced adiposity gain. Each additional daily serving of fruit juice was associated with an excess adiposity gain of 0.009 SD per month. Feeding restriction was greater among parents whose children were initially at risk for overweight or overweight compared with those at a healthy weight. Parental exposure to nutritional messages was not associated with reduced child adiposity gain.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study supports the Institute of Medicine recommendations to reduce fruit juice intake as a strategy for overweight prevention in high-risk children.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe goal of this study was to understand the association between children's neighborhood food access and overweight/obesity in a national sample of US households, and whether this association differs by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation or household purchases.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were obtained from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (2012-2013; n = 3,748 children aged 2 to 18 years). Logistic regression was used to examine associations between neighborhood retail food access (≤1 mile from home), food purchases (including sugary beverages), and overweight/obesity, stratified by SNAP status (1,720 participants, 453 eligible nonparticipants, 1,575 SNAP ineligible). Store types included supermarkets/grocery, combination grocery/other (independent drug, dollar, and general stores), convenience, fast food, and non-fast food restaurants.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOdds of childhood overweight/obesity (OR [95% CI]) were higher with greater access to combination grocery/other stores overall (1.10 [1.03-1.17]) and for children in SNAP (1.14 [1.05-1.24]). Eligible non-SNAP children had higher odds of overweight/obesity with greater access to convenience stores (1.11 [1.04-1.18]). The average child lived in a household with 6.3% of total spending at food outlets on sugary beverages (SNAP: 8.3%, eligible non-SNAP: 7.7%, SNAP ineligible: 5.5%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGreater neighborhood access to combination grocery/other stores is associated with higher obesity prevalence for children overall and those in SNAP.",

Caregivers of 95 predominantly Hispanic and African-Arnerican WIC-enrolled children aged 18-56 months presenting for recertification completed questionnaires. Half were overweight (>85th% BMI) and 36% were obese (>95th% BMI); 21% met CDC criteria for anemia. Two thirds (63%) received daily bottles of milk or sweet liquids. Daily bottle use ranged from 3 to 10 (mean=3.3, median=3). Bottle use was significantly associated with obesity (>95th% BMI, p<0.0005), not significant with overweight (>85th% BMI, p<0.06) and statistically significant with IDA.",

        "abstract": "&NA; The effects of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on obesity have been the focus of much debate. However, causal interpretation of estimates from previous studies, comparing participants to non‐participants, is complicated by endogeneity and possible misreporting of participation in SNAP. In this paper, we take a novel approach to examine quasi‐experimental variation in SNAP benefit amount on adult obesity. Children of SNAP households qualify for free in‐school meals, thus freeing some additional benefits for the household. A greater proportion of school‐age children eligible for free in‐school meals proxies for an exogenous increase in the amount of SNAP benefits available per adult. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth‐1979 we show that school meals represent a non‐trivial part of the food budget for SNAP households. We find that increases in SNAP benefits have no effect on obesity levels for the full sample of those who report SNAP participation. To better isolate the effects of additional benefits from other potential changes we restrict our analysis to adults living in households with at least one child under 5 years of age. In this setting, we find that additional SNAP benefits reduce BMI and the probability of being obese for SNAP adults. Specifically, when one child in a household of four becomes school‐aged, adult BMI is expected to decrease by 0.23 units and the probability of being obese decreases by 2.58 percentage points or by about 10%.",

        "abstract": "The field of nutrition is in the midst of a major and rapid transition. Just how far we have come can be illustrated by the judgement that it is possible, and indeed desirable, to define multiple criteria of adequacy, multiple levels of requirement, and hence a multitiered population assessment. Moreover, in the past few years, there has also been widespread acceptance of other important concepts: no single dietary standard meets every user's needs; the quality of a diet, as well as its quantity, needs to be considered; alternative dietary standards are required and available; and finally, patterns of dietary intakes must be considered. Finally, there are fresh approaches to the relation of dietary factors and free radicals that appear to be most promising. Indeed, the issues are still unresolved, but a new definition of what RDA might mean may well emerge, along with the other evolving alternative dietary standards. The addition of a new category of naturally occurring compounds to be taken prophylactically under certain circumstances of high risk from free radicals, emphasizes the magnitude of the progress that has already been achieved.",

Using surveys conducted in 118 Baltimore City, Maryland, food stores in 2006 and 2012, we examined associations of the change in healthy food availability with store type, neighborhood demographics, and the 2009 WIC policy change. Overall, healthy food availability improved significantly between 2006 and 2012, with the greatest increases in corner stores and in census tracts with more than 60 percent black residents. On an 11-point scale measuring availability of fruit (3 points), vegetables (4 points), bread (2 points), and milk (2 points), the WIC policy change was associated with a 0.72-point increase in WIC-relevant healthy food availability, while joining WIC was associated with a 0.99-point increase. Stores that carry a limited variety of food items may be more receptive to stocking healthier food than previously thought, particularly within neighborhoods with a majority of black residents. Policies targeting healthy food availability have the potential to increase availability and decrease health disparities.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAdults with chronic disease are often unable to meet medication and food needs, but no study has examined the relationship between cost-related medication underuse and food insecurity in a nationally representative sample. We examined which groups most commonly face unmet food and medication needs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCross-sectional analysis of data from chronically ill participants (self-report of arthritis, diabetes mellitus, cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or presence of a \"psychiatric problem\") aged ≥20 years, in the 2011 National Health Interview Survey. We fit logistic regression models to identify factors associated with food insecurity, cost-related medication underuse, or both.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 9696 adult National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) participants who reported chronic illness; 23.4% reported cost-related medication underuse; 18.8% reported food insecurity; and 11% reported both. Adults who reported food insecurity were significantly more likely to report cost-related medication underuse (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.03). Participants with both cost-related medication underuse and food insecurity were more likely to be Hispanic (aOR 1.58), non-Hispanic black (aOR 1.58), and have more chronic conditions (aOR per additional chronic condition 1.56) than patients reporting neither. They also were less likely to have public, non-Medicare insurance (aOR 0.70) and report participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Woman, Infants, and Children (aOR 0.39).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nApproximately 1 in 3 chronically ill NHIS participants are unable to afford food, medications, or both. WIC and public health insurance participation are associated with less food insecurity and cost-related medication underuse.",

        "abstract": "Hospital practices and early maternal return to work are associated with breastfeeding duration; however, research has not documented the long-term effects of many hospital policies or the effect of early return to work on breastfeeding outcomes of WIC participants. This study investigated the impact of in-hospital breastfeeding, receipt of a formula discharge pack, and maternal return to work on the long-term breastfeeding outcomes of 4,725 WIC participants in Los Angeles County, California. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess determinants of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months and breastfeeding at 6, 12, and 24 months. In-hospital initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding in the hospital, receipt of a formula discharge pack, and maternal return to work before 3 months were all significantly associated with breastfeeding outcomes after controlling for known confounders. Mothers who exclusively breastfed in the hospital were eight times as likely as mothers who did not breastfeed in the hospital to reach the AAP recommendation of breastfeeding for 12 months or longer (P < .01). Only 6.9% of the sample reported exclusively breastfeeding for 6 months or more, and just one-third reported any breastfeeding at 12 months. Nine in ten respondents received a formula discharge pack in the hospital. Mothers who received a discharge pack were half as likely to exclusively breastfeed at 6 months as those who did not receive one (P < .01). Medical providers should educate, encourage, and support WIC mothers to breastfeed in the hospital and refrain from giving formula discharge packs.",

        "abstract": "Hospital practices and early maternal return to work are associated with breastfeeding duration; however, research has not documented the long-term effects of many hospital policies or the effect of early return to work on breastfeeding outcomes of WIC participants. This study investigated the impact of in-hospital breastfeeding, receipt of a formula discharge pack, and maternal return to work on the long-term breastfeeding outcomes of 4,725 WIC participants in Los Angeles County, California. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess determinants of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months and breastfeeding at 6, 12, and 24 months. In-hospital initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding in the hospital, receipt of a formula discharge pack, and maternal return to work before 3 months were all significantly associated with breastfeeding outcomes after controlling for known confounders. Mothers who exclusively breastfed in the hospital were eight times as likely as mothers who did not breastfeed in the hospital to reach the AAP recommendation of breastfeeding for 12 months or longer (P < .01). Only 6.9% of the sample reported exclusively breastfeeding for 6 months or more, and just one-third reported any breastfeeding at 12 months. Nine in ten respondents received a formula discharge pack in the hospital. Mothers who received a discharge pack were half as likely to exclusively breastfeed at 6 months as those who did not receive one (P < .01). Medical providers should educate, encourage, and support WIC mothers to breastfeed in the hospital and refrain from giving formula discharge packs.",

        "abstract": "Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intakes in the United States (US) lag behind dietary recommendations despite their positive nutrition profile, health benefits for reducing chronic disease risk, and inclusion in nutrition assistance programs. Low-income groups, including Hispanics, have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some cancers. Hispanic dietary quality and bean consumption may decline with increasing acculturation. Intakes at recommended levels could improve health in all vulnerable low-income populations. The study objectives were to describe dry and canned bean preferences, consumption frequency, and attitudes among low-income Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women, and to assess if these characteristics differed by ethnicity and acculturation level among the Latinas. A convenience sample of 158 women, aged 18⁻65 years, completed a written survey in English or Spanish at two healthcare clinics, one Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children office, and five County Extension nutrition education and outreach programs in Iowa. Less acculturated Latinas consumed beans more often, preferred dry to canned, bought in bulk, valued color and shape in dry bean selection, and held less positive attitudes toward canned beans in contrast to bicultural/more acculturated and non-Hispanic white women. Ethnicity and acculturation level have a role in varying purchase patterns and attitudes regarding dry and canned beans. Culturally-held differences should be considered in nutrition programs and leveraged to increase consumption and improve health.",

        "abstract": "Background: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s (MDPH) Mass in Motion Program (MiM) facilitates the adoption of community-level strategies that promote healthy weight in 52 municipalities. MiM provided the platform for enhancing postdischarge continuity of care for breastfeeding. Objective: This study aimed to improve the continuity of breastfeeding care and support for mothers by enhancing postdischarge care infrastructure and supportive contacts for women and families. Methods: The MDPH awarded catalyst grants to community-based organizations (CBOs) that facilitated the formation of teams for improving breastfeeding support. The effort focused on populations that often experience disparities in breastfeeding outcomes such as minority women and women receiving Medicaid. The Added Value Model of Community Coalitions was used to qualitatively assess effect across multiple levels of the socioecological model of influence. Results: Six communities were awarded grants to enhance or convene Breastfeeding Continuity-of-Care Teams consisting of at least 3 CBOs, including 1 maternity hospital, the local Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and the local MiM representative. Teams implemented customized plans with performance indicators to create and strengthen infrastructure for supportive contacts with breastfeeding mothers. The project included Baby Café pilots in 3 additional MiM communities. Across all grantee communities, there was an average total increase of 491 contacts with mothers per month, an improvement of 8.5% over baseline. The project created 153 added value outcomes of community collaboration at 5 levels in the socioecological framework. Conclusion: The project demonstrated how cross-sector, coordinated efforts focused on vulnerable populations can leverage local strengths to establish/enhance breastfeeding support services customized to local needs.",

        "abstract": "The development and promotion of farmers' markets and community gardens is growing in popularity as a strategy to increase community-wide fruit and vegetable consumption. Despite large numbers of farmers' markets and community gardens in the United States, as well as widespread enthusiasm for their use as a health promotion tool, little is known about their influence on dietary intake. This review examines the current scientific literature on the implications of farmers' market programs and community gardens on nutrition-related outcomes in adults. Studies published between January 1980 and January 2009 were identified via PubMed and Agricola database searches and by examining reference lists from relevant studies. Studies were included in this review if they took place in the United States and qualitatively or quantitatively examined nutrition-related outcomes, including dietary intake; attitudes and beliefs regarding buying, preparing, or eating fruits and vegetables; and behaviors and perceptions related to obtaining produce from a farmers' market or community garden. Studies focusing on garden-based youth programs were excluded. In total, 16 studies were identified for inclusion in this review. Seven studies focused on the impact of farmers' market nutrition programs for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children participants, five focused on the influence of farmers' market programs for seniors, and four focused on community gardens. Findings from this review reveal that few well-designed research studies (eg, those incorporating control groups) utilizing valid and reliable dietary assessment methods to evaluate the influence of farmers' markets and community gardens on nutrition-related outcomes have been completed. Recommendations for future research on the dietary influences of farmers' markets and community gardens are provided.",

These recommendations, however, are at odds with international (e.g., Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia) guidelines that provide no specific numerical recommendation, but instead recommend reducing total fat intake and shifting fat consumption away from saturated and trans fats to unsaturated fats. A conference was held on December 3, 2008, to evaluate the data supporting current US nutrition policy recommendations to limit dietary cholesterol and analyze the consequences of this policy on the eating patterns and health of the US population.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which are distributed monthly, help low-income families put food on their tables. Both food spending and caloric intake among recipients decrease over the month following benefit receipt. This pattern, termed the \"SNAP-cycle,\" has serious implications for health and food security of low-income households. To understand better the SNAP-cycle, this study explored (1) differences in diet quality between SNAP and non-SNAP households and (2) the association between the SNAP-cycle and diet quality.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMultivariate linear regression with SNAP households in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey to evaluate changes in diet quality as time from SNAP distribution increased. Diet quality of food purchases was measured by Healthy Eating Index-2010 total and component scores. Data were collected 2012-2013 and analyzed 2016-2017.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall dietary quality was low throughout the SNAP-cycle (n=1,377, mean Healthy Eating Index 46.14 of 100). SNAP households had significantly lower Healthy Eating Index scores compared with eligible and ineligible nonparticipants (p<0.05). After controlling for covariates, households in the final 10 days of the benefit cycle had Healthy Eating Index-2010 total scores 2.95 points lower than all other SNAP households (p=0.02). Significant declines in Healthy Eating Index fruit and vegetable scores contributed to worsening diet quality over the SNAP-cycle.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides evidence of low dietary quality throughout the SNAP-cycle with significantly lower Healthy Eating Index scores in the final 10 days of the benefit month. This suggests less healthy purchasing occurs when resources are diminished, but overall that current SNAP levels are insufficient to consistently purchase foods according to dietary guidelines.",

        "abstract": "The goals of this study are to estimate federal maternal and child health (MCH) expenditures and identify their sources. This analysis is intended to provide a broad view of MCH funding appropriations and a basis for discussion of whether funds could be better utilized for the benefit of the population served. Data on federal maternal and child health expenditures for fiscal year (FY) 2006 were derived from examining federal legislation, department/agency budgets, and various web-based program documents posted by federal agencies. Based on selected criteria, we identified programs targeting children under 21 or pregnant/parenting women within the United States. The funding levels of agency programs for maternal and child health activities were determined and the programs briefly summarized. The identifiable funding for maternal and child health programs in FY 2006 approached $57.5 billion dollars. Funding sources for maternal and child health were concentrated within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, but spread across several different agencies within the department and in the Departments of Defense, Education, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Multiple agencies and offices often funded related activities, without evidence of a common underlying strategy. Federal maternal and child health funding mechanisms may lead to a fragmentation in maternal and child health activities. The funding and service delivery apparatus would benefit from an integrative MCH infrastructure approach to pediatric research, service delivery, and data collection/access that incorporates life-course and social/environmental determinants perspectives.",

Customer intercept interviews (n = 594) collected purchase data from a bag check and demographics from a survey. Store measures included fruit/vegetable and whole grain availability, an overall Healthy Food Supply Score (HFSS), healthy food advertisements and in-store placement, and shelf space of key items. Customer nutritional measures were analyzed using Nutrient Databases System for Research (NDSR), and included the purchase of ≥1 serving of fruits/vegetables; ≥1 serving of whole grains; and overall Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) score for foods/beverages purchased. Associations between store and customer measures were estimated in multilevel linear and logistic regression models, controlling for customer characteristics and store type.ResultsFew customers purchased fruits and vegetables (8%) or whole grains (8%). In fully adjusted models, purchase HEI-2010 scores were associated with fruit/vegetable shelf space (p = 0.002) and the ratio of shelf space devoted to healthy vs. less healthy items (p = 0.0002). Offering ≥14 varieties of fruit/vegetables was associated with produce purchases (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2–12.3), as was having produce visible from the store entrance (OR 2.3 95% CI 1.0 to 5.8), but whole grain availability measures were not associated with whole grain purchases.ConclusionsStrategies addressing both customer demand and the availability of healthy food may be necessary to improve customer purchases.Trial registrationClinialTrials.gov: NCT02774330.

        "abstract": "For 20 years, Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work (Loving Support) has been the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) national breastfeeding (BF) promotion and support campaign and the foundation for BF efforts in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). The goals of the campaign are to increase BF initiation and duration rates as well as provide support to WIC participants. The campaign is based on a social marketing approach, emphasizing the importance of the support of family, friends, health care providers, employers, and the community for BF success. Through a contract with the USDA Food and Nutrition Service in April, 2011 and January, 2012, the Institute of Medicine (renamed the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2015) assembled experts to provide guidance on actions needed to update the existing campaign. One aspect discussed was using technology and social media to reach millennial mothers, the 37 million women born in the US between 1977 and 1994. This group uses social media as a major tool for communication; its members' phones are ‘‘a functional tool that they cannot live without.’’",

        "abstract": "The Food Stamp Program has grown from a modest effort to distribute excess farm commodities during the Great Depression to the nation's largest food assistance and nutrition program, serving almost 27 million persons in fiscal year 2006, at a cost of more than 30 billion dollars to federal taxpayers. In 1990 Congress authorized cost sharing for food stamp nutrition education. Since 1992-when only seven states had approved food stamp nutrition education plans totaling 661,076 dollars in federal dollars-the nutrition education program has grown exponentially. In 2007, there were 52 food stamp nutrition education plans for states and territories approved at a total cost of more than 275 million dollars. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of the Food Stamp Program from its inception in May 1939 through 2006, including program milestones, changes that have occurred as the result of legislation, and the growth and effectiveness of nutrition education to Food Stamp Program participants. Future investigations are needed to study processes for development and validation of evaluation measures as required by the US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service and to examine the effects of food stamp nutrition education on behavior changes affecting health and nutrition of Food Stamp Program participants.",

        "abstract": "Onto the world-fastest ageing of society, the world-lowest fertility rate prompted a development of various policies and programs for a betterment of the population in Korea. Since the vulnerability of young children of low socio-economic class to malnutrition was clearly shown at the in-depth analysis of the 2001 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, an effort to devise supplemental nutrition care program for pregnant/breastfeeding women, infants and preschool children was initiated. The program was designed to offer nutrition education tailored to fit the needs of the participants and special supplementary foods, using USDA WIC program as a benchmark. Based on the dietary intake of those age groups, target nutrients were selected and their major food sources were searched through nutrient content of foods and dietary pattern analysis. As a result, we developed 6 kinds of food packages using combinations of 11 different food items. The amount of each item in a food package was determined to supplement the intake deficit in target nutrients. Nutrition education in NutriPlus(+) aims to improve the nutrition knowledge, attitude, and dietary behaviors of the participants, and is provided through group lessons, individual counseling sessions and home visits. Breastfeeding is promoted with top priority in education for the health of both mother and baby. The eligibility guidelines were set for residency, household income, age, pregnancy/breastfeeding and nutritional risk such as anemia, stunting, underweight, and/or inadequate nutrient intake. Income eligibility was defined as household income less than 200 percent of the Korean poverty guidelines. A pilot study to examine the feasibility of program implementation was run in 3 public health centers in 2005 and expanded to 15 and 20 in the following 2 years. The result of 3-year pilot study will be reported separately along with the ultimate nationwide implementation of the NutriPlus(+) in 2008.",

To achieve food security, effective interventions are needed, along with adequate funding for, and increased utilization of, food and nutrition assistance programs; inclusion of nutrition education in such programs; strategies to support individual and household economic stability; and research to measure impact on food insecurity- and health-related outcomes. Millions of individuals living in the United States experience food insecurity. Negative nutritional and non-nutritional outcomes are associated with food insecurity across the lifespan, including substandard academic achievement, inadequate intake of key nutrients, increased risk for chronic disease, and poor psychological and cognitive functioning. Registered dietitian nutritionists and nutrition and dietetics technicians, registered, play key roles in addressing food insecurity and are uniquely positioned to make valuable contributions through competent and collaborative practice, provision of comprehensive food and nutrition education and training, innovative research related to all aspects of food insecurity, and advocacy efforts at the local, state, regional, and national levels.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nPerinatal outcomes have improved in developed countries but remain poor for disadvantaged populations. We examined whether an unconditional income supplement to low-income pregnant women was associated with improved birth outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study included all mother-newborn pairs (2003-2010) in Manitoba, Canada, where the mother received prenatal social assistance, the infant was born in the hospital, and the pair had a risk screen (N = 14 591). Low-income women who received the income supplement (Healthy Baby Prenatal Benefit [HBPB], n = 10 738) were compared with low-income women who did not receive HBPB (n = 3853) on the following factors: low birth weight, preterm, small and large for gestational age, Apgar score, breastfeeding initiation, neonatal readmission, and newborn hospital length of stay (LOS). Covariates from risk screens were used to develop propensity scores and to balance differences between groups in regression models; γ sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Population-attributable and preventable fractions were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHBPB was associated with reductions in low birth weight (aRR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.63-0.81]), preterm births (aRR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.69-0.84]) and small for gestational age births (aRR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81-0.99]) and increases in breastfeeding (aRR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.03-1.09]) and large for gestational age births (aRR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-1.23]). For vaginal births, HBPB was associated with shortened LOS (weighted mean, 2.86; P < .0001). Results for breastfeeding, low birth weight, preterm birth, and LOS were robust to unmeasured confounding. Reductions of 21% (95% CI, 13.6-28.3) for low birth weight births and 17.5% (95% CI, 11.2-23.8) for preterm births were associated with HBPB.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nReceipt of an unconditional prenatal income supplement was associated with positive outcomes. Placing conditions on income supplements may not be necessary to promote prenatal and perinatal health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nPerinatal outcomes have improved in developed countries but remain poor for disadvantaged populations. We examined whether an unconditional income supplement to low-income pregnant women was associated with improved birth outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study included all mother-newborn pairs (2003-2010) in Manitoba, Canada, where the mother received prenatal social assistance, the infant was born in the hospital, and the pair had a risk screen (N = 14 591). Low-income women who received the income supplement (Healthy Baby Prenatal Benefit [HBPB], n = 10 738) were compared with low-income women who did not receive HBPB (n = 3853) on the following factors: low birth weight, preterm, small and large for gestational age, Apgar score, breastfeeding initiation, neonatal readmission, and newborn hospital length of stay (LOS). Covariates from risk screens were used to develop propensity scores and to balance differences between groups in regression models; γ sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Population-attributable and preventable fractions were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHBPB was associated with reductions in low birth weight (aRR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.63-0.81]), preterm births (aRR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.69-0.84]) and small for gestational age births (aRR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81-0.99]) and increases in breastfeeding (aRR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.03-1.09]) and large for gestational age births (aRR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-1.23]). For vaginal births, HBPB was associated with shortened LOS (weighted mean, 2.86; P < .0001). Results for breastfeeding, low birth weight, preterm birth, and LOS were robust to unmeasured confounding. Reductions of 21% (95% CI, 13.6-28.3) for low birth weight births and 17.5% (95% CI, 11.2-23.8) for preterm births were associated with HBPB.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nReceipt of an unconditional prenatal income supplement was associated with positive outcomes. Placing conditions on income supplements may not be necessary to promote prenatal and perinatal health.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nHead Start is a federally funded early childhood education program that serves just over 900,000 US children, many of whom are at risk for obesity, are living in food insecure households, or both. The objective of this study was to describe Head Start practices related to assessing body mass index (BMI), addressing food insecurity, and determining portion sizes at meals.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA survey was mailed in 2008 to all eligible Head Start programs (N = 1,810) as part of the Study of Healthy Activity and Eating Practices and Environments in Head Start. We describe program directors' responses to questions about BMI, food insecurity, and portion sizes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe response rate was 87% (N = 1,583). Nearly all programs (99.5%) reported obtaining height and weight data, 78% of programs calculated BMI for all children, and 50% of programs discussed height and weight measurements with all families. In 14% of programs, directors reported that staff often or very often saw children who did not seem to be getting enough to eat at home; 55% saw this sometimes, 26% rarely, and 5% never. Fifty-four percent of programs addressed perceived food insecurity by giving extra food to children and families. In 39% of programs, staff primarily decided what portion sizes children received at meals, and in 55% the children primarily decided on their own portions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHead Start programs should consider moving resources from assessing BMI to assessing household food security and providing training and technical assistance to help staff manage children's portion sizes.",

        "abstract": "Both household food insecurity and childhood overweight are serious public health problems that appear to be paradoxically correlated. This study examines the relationship between overweight and household food insecurity with/without hunger in low-income children participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Weight, height, and household food insecurity data were collected on 8,493 children ages 1 month to 5 years and analyzed by sex and age groups using logistic regression to model the odds of being overweight (weight for length or body mass index [calculated as kg/m(2)] for age > or =95th percentile) given household food insecurity status, controlling for race/ethnicity and maternal education. Analyses were stratified by age and sex because interaction terms with household food insecurity were significant (P<0.10). In this sample, prevalence of household food insecurity was 30.7% (8.3% with hunger) and 18.4% were overweight. Among girls younger than 2 years of age, household food insecurity was associated with reduced odds of overweight compared with food-secure households (odds ratio=0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.47 to 0.88); hunger status did not alter this association. Among 2- to 5-year-old girls, there was no overall significant association between household food insecurity and overweight; however, household food insecurity with hunger was positively associated with overweight compared with those from food-secure households (odds ratio=1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 2.10). No association between household food insecurity and overweight was found among boys. These findings suggest an association between household food insecurity and overweight prevalence in this low-income population. However, sex and age appear to modify both the magnitude and direction of the association.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe most recent statistics indicate that the prevalence of food insecurity in the United States is double that in Canada, but the extent to which the nutrition implications of this problem differ between the countries is not known.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study was undertaken to compare adequacy of nutrient intakes in relation to household food insecurity among youth and adults in Canada and the United States.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from comparable nationally representative surveys, the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey and the 2003-2006 NHANES, were used to estimate prevalences of inadequate intakes of vitamins A and C, folate, calcium, magnesium, and zinc among youth and adults in food-secure and food-insecure households. Potential differences in the composition of the populations between the 2 countries were addressed by using standardization, and analyses also accounted for participation in food and nutrition assistance programs in the United States.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLarger gaps in the prevalences of inadequate intakes between those in food-secure and food-insecure households were observed in Canada than in the United States for calcium and magnesium. For calcium, the prevalences of inadequate intakes among those in food-secure and food-insecure households in Canada were 50% and 66%, respectively, compared with 50% and 51%, respectively, in the United States. For magnesium, the prevalences of inadequate intakes in Canada were 39% and 60% among those in food-secure and food-insecure households, respectively, compared with 60% and 61%, respectively, in the United States. These findings were largely unchanged after we accounted for participation in food and nutrition assistance programs in the United States.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study suggests that household food insecurity is a stronger marker of nutritional vulnerability in Canada than in the United States. The results highlight the need for research to elucidate the effects of domestic policies affecting factors such as food prices and fortification on the nutritional manifestations of food insecurity.",

        "abstract": "Low-income, multi-ethnic women are at elevated risk for obesity and chronic diseases, yet influences at different levels may act as barriers to changing risk behaviors. Following the birth of a child, childrearing and social isolation can exacerbate these influences. The social ecological framework integrates behavior-change strategies at different levels, providing a strong theoretical base for developing interventions in this high-risk population. The primary purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of an educational model delivered by community-based paraprofessionals in improving diet, activity and weight loss among new mothers over a 12-month postpartum period and a 6-month maintenance period. This model fosters institutional change to support behavior changes influenced at intrapersonal and interpersonal levels, through collaboration with federal programs for low-income families: the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). Participants are randomized to the Usual Care, e.g. WIC nutrition and breastfeeding education, or Enhanced EFNEP intervention arm, consisting of Usual WIC Care plus a sustained, multi-component intervention including home visits, group classes and monthly telephone counseling. If shown to be efficacious, this program will be readily sustainable through existing federal agencies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo assess Latina mothers' health beliefs and attitudes regarding early childhood weight issues and to use the information to update current nutrition education methods.\n\n\nDESIGN\nData were collected in eight focus group sessions using a semistructured questionnaire.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/SETTING\nForty-three Latina mothers (and grandmothers) with children aged 2 to 5 years were recruited at five different Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children sites in California.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nTranscripts of focus groups were imported into QSR NUD*IST software, facilitating in-depth iterative analysis of emergent themes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifteen emergent themes were identified and organized into four functional domains relevant to nutrition education: health beliefs surrounding weight, impact and cause of overweight, life values and concerns, and strategies for making changes in children's eating and activity patterns. Information from this qualitative study demonstrates that the traditional nutrition counseling paradigm may not be effective with Latina mothers. In addition, cultural beliefs can be barriers to successful prevention and treatment of overweight. To ensure that culturally competent services are provided, educators must be prepared to adjust education approaches according to the cultural background of the clients. Key among the issues was mothers' difficulty acknowledging overweight among their children and their perception that health and weight were poorly associated. Certain cultural values were identified as barriers to adopting healthful behaviors. Mothers were able to identify specific ways in which nutrition education could be improved.\n\n\nAPPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggest that nutrition education efforts targeting Latina mothers of young children can be reframed to better address the belief system and cultural framework of the population, like identifying positive eating behaviors rather than focusing on a child's weight.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nUnhealthful diet is a top contributor to chronic diseases in the United States. There are growing concerns about disparities in diet among US adults, especially for those who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest federal food assistance program. It remains unclear how these disparities may have changed over time.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess whether disparities in key food groups and nutrients according to participation and eligibility for SNAP have persisted, improved, or worsened over time among US adults.\n\n\nDESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS\nThis survey study examined a nationally representative sample of 38 696 adults aged 20 years or older: 6162 SNAP participants, 6692 income-eligible nonparticipants, and 25 842 higher-income individuals from 8 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2014). Data analysis was conducted between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017.\n\n\nEXPOSURES\nSurvey-weighted, energy-adjusted diet by SNAP participation status.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nMean diet scores and proportions of US adults meeting poor, intermediate, or ideal diet scores based on the American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 Strategic Impact Goals for diet, including 8 components (fruits and vegetables; whole grains; fish and shellfish; sugar-sweetened beverages; sodium; nuts, seeds, and legumes; processed meats; and saturated fat).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe survey included 38 696 respondents (20 062 female [51.9%]; 18 386 non-Hispanic white [69.8%]; mean [SD] age, 46.8 [14.8] years). Participants of SNAP were younger (mean [SD] age, 41.4 [15.6] years) than income-eligible nonparticipants (mean [SD] age, 44.9 [19.6] years) or higher-income individuals (mean [SD] age, 47.8 [13.6] years); more likely to be female (3552 of 6162 [58.6%] vs 3504 of 6692 [54.8%] and 13 006 of 25 842 [50.4%], respectively); and less likely to be non-Hispanic white (2062 of 6162 [48.2%] vs 2594 of 6692 [56.0%] and 13 712 of 25 842 [75.8%], respectively). From surveys conducted in 2003 and 2004 to those conducted in 2013 and 2014, SNAP participants had less improvement in AHA diet scores than both income-eligible nonparticipants and higher-income individuals (change in mean score = 0.57 [95% CI, -2.18 to 0.33] vs 2.56 [95% CI, 0.36-4.76] and 3.84 [95% CI, 2.39-5.29], respectively; P = .04 for interaction). Disparities persisted for most foods and nutrients and worsened for processed meats, added sugars, and nuts and seeds. In 2013 to 2014, a higher proportion of SNAP participants had poor diet scores compared with income-eligible nonparticipants and higher-income individuals (461 of 950 [53.5%] vs 247 of 690 [38.0%] and 773 of 2797 [28.7%]; P < .001 for difference), and a lower proportion had intermediate diet scores (477 of 950 [45.3%] vs 428 of 690 [59.8%] and 1933 of 2797 [68.7%]; P < .001 for difference). The proportion of participants with ideal diet scores was low in all 3 groups (12 of 950 [1.3%] vs 15 of 690 [2.2%] and 91 of 2797 [2.6%]; P = .26 for difference).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nDietary disparities persisted or worsened for most dietary components among US adults. Despite improvement in some dietary components, SNAP participants still do not meet the AHA goals for a healthful diet.",

        "abstract": "We investigated Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation among citizen, documented and undocumented immigrant hired crop farmworkers for ten recent years. We analyzed population representative data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey for 2003–2012 (N = 18,243 households). Time-chart, simple mean differences, and logistic regressions described farmworker household participation in SNAP. The 2008 financial crisis almost doubled SNAP-participation by agriculture households (6.5% in 2003–2007 vs. 11.3% in 2008–2012). The increasing SNAP-participation was found for citizen, documented and undocumented immigrant households. We found low participation among documented (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56–0.8) and undocumented immigrants (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.54–0.74) compared to citizens. Low odds ratios (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55–0.89) were found for Hispanic-citizens as compared with non-Hispanic white-citizens. Our results may help inform the debate surrounding the effects of the financial crisis on SNAP-participation and on differences in participation among citizens, immigrants, Hispanics and non-Hispanics, the latter suggesting ethnic farmworker disparities in SNAP-participation.",

        "abstract": "Focus groups were used to examine relationships among maternal beliefs, feeding intentions, and infant-feeding behaviors among 65 Women, Infants and Children-eligible (28 English-speaking and 37 Spanish-speaking) mothers. Participants shared common beliefs that breast-feeding was beneficial; nevertheless, many believed that early introduction of formula and solid foods was unavoidable in certain situations. Medical providers and Women, Infants and Children staff were sources of infant-feeding information, and the Spanish-speaking mothers attempted to adhere to the guidance. However, the English-speaking mothers often ignored this advice if it was not perceived as working for the family’s circumstances. Mothers, believing that providers would not understand that they were compelled to reject infant-feeding recommendations, would not ask for assistance when facing difficulties. Instead, mothers relied on relatives and others for infant-feeding guidance. Educational efforts should acknowledge mothers’ true circumstances, target support to each situation, and emphasize the health value of complementary foods rather than their association with infant motor development.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE\nWhile breastfeeding is well recognized as beneficial, rates of breastfeeding among American Indian women are below average and contribute to health inequities. Culturally specific approaches to breastfeeding research are called for to inform appropriate interventions in American Indian communities. Specifically, a grandmother's role in breastfeeding promotion is of great import particularly in American Indian (AI) groups, although is an understudied topic to date.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis research seeks to fill a prominent literature gap by utilizing a grounded theory and community-based research approach to inform breastfeeding practices from the voices of grandmothers and health care professionals in a rural AI community in the United States.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA community-based approach guided the research process. Convenience and snowball sampling was used to recruit for semi-structured and follow up member checking interviews with AI grandmothers (n = 27) and health care professionals (n = 7). Qualitative data were transcribed, characterized into meaning units, and coded by a review panel. Data were reconciled for discrepancies among reviewers, organized thematically, and used to generate community-specific breastfeeding constructs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree major themes emerged, each with relevant subthemes: (1) importance of breastfeeding; (2) attachment, bonding, and passing on knowledge; and (3) overburdened health care system. Multiple subthemes represent stressors and impact breastfeeding knowledge, translation, and practice within this community including formula beliefs, historical traumas, societal pressures, mistrust, and substance abuse.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInterventions designed to raise breastfeeding rates in the study site community would ideally be grounded in tribal resources and involve a collaborative approach that engages the greater community, grandmothers, health care professionals, and scientific partners with varying skills. More research is needed to determine stressors and any potential impact on infant feeding practices among other AI groups. Application of the research approach presented here to other AI communities may be beneficial for understanding opportunities and challenges to breastfeeding practices.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nPerinatal outcomes have improved in developed countries but remain poor for disadvantaged populations. We examined whether an unconditional income supplement to low-income pregnant women was associated with improved birth outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study included all mother-newborn pairs (2003-2010) in Manitoba, Canada, where the mother received prenatal social assistance, the infant was born in the hospital, and the pair had a risk screen (N = 14 591). Low-income women who received the income supplement (Healthy Baby Prenatal Benefit [HBPB], n = 10 738) were compared with low-income women who did not receive HBPB (n = 3853) on the following factors: low birth weight, preterm, small and large for gestational age, Apgar score, breastfeeding initiation, neonatal readmission, and newborn hospital length of stay (LOS). Covariates from risk screens were used to develop propensity scores and to balance differences between groups in regression models; γ sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess sensitivity to unmeasured confounding. Population-attributable and preventable fractions were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHBPB was associated with reductions in low birth weight (aRR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.63-0.81]), preterm births (aRR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.69-0.84]) and small for gestational age births (aRR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81-0.99]) and increases in breastfeeding (aRR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.03-1.09]) and large for gestational age births (aRR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-1.23]). For vaginal births, HBPB was associated with shortened LOS (weighted mean, 2.86; P < .0001). Results for breastfeeding, low birth weight, preterm birth, and LOS were robust to unmeasured confounding. Reductions of 21% (95% CI, 13.6-28.3) for low birth weight births and 17.5% (95% CI, 11.2-23.8) for preterm births were associated with HBPB.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nReceipt of an unconditional prenatal income supplement was associated with positive outcomes. Placing conditions on income supplements may not be necessary to promote prenatal and perinatal health.",

        "abstract": "The United States has achieved dramatic improvements in overall maternal and child health status, yet faces disturbingly wide variations in the health status of many population subgroups. The Surgeon General in 1980 published specific quantitative objectives to stimulate further improvements in the health of the American people by 1990. A critical step in meeting relevant objectives is the more effective use at national, state, and local levels of available data, particularly infant, perinatal, neonatal, and maternal mortality rates and the incidence of low weight births. This paper reviews variations in infant mortality rates and five current federal “categorical” programs that aim to improve maternal and child health: Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants and Children; Head Start; Maternal and Child Health; Family Planning; and Community Health Centers. Several examples are cited of effective use of data in the coordination and targeting of resources from these large public programs. Recommendations are made for enhancement of federal maternal and child health programs within current funding levels. These recommendations will be all the more relevant if the Congress enacts block grants to the states with lower total funding.",

        "abstract": "The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is the official nutrition policy statement for the United States. Government involvement in providing information on private behavior, such as food choice, is justified by the high cost of poor diets, as measured in medical expenses and lost productivity. The Guidelines are intended to provide an up-to-date, consistent information base for federal nutrition education and information efforts and food assistance program regulations. Through these policy mechanisms, the Guidelines are assumed to improve dietary behavior, and, ultimately, health. By law, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans must be updated every five years; however, there is no mandate for evaluation. Evaluation could provide useful information to assess the extent to which the Guidelines positively influence health and provide insights into reasons for their successes and limitations. However, evaluation would also present considerable challenges. This paper discusses the critical data and methodological needs for improving evaluation of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nIron and zinc share common food sources, and children at risk of iron deficiency may also develop zinc deficiency. We determined the prevalence of zinc and copper deficiency and examined factors associated with serum zinc and copper in young children from low-income families at risk of iron deficiency.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA cross-sectional study design was used to assess serum zinc and copper, along with an interview-assisted survey to assess factors associated with serum zinc and copper in a convenience sample.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/SETTING\nParticipants were 435 children aged 12 to 36 months recruited from select clinics of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in Contra Costa and Tulare Counties, California.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED\nFrequencies were used to report prevalence. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine factors associated with serum zinc and copper, controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of low serum zinc level (<70 microg/dL [<10.7 micromol/L]) was 42.8%, and low serum copper level (<90 microg/dL [<14.2 micromol/L]) was <1%. Mean+/-standard deviation of serum copper was 150+/-22 microg/dL (23.6+/-3.5 micromol/L) and 140+/-24 microg/dL (22.1+/-3.8 micromol/L) for anemic and non-anemic children, respectively (t test, P=0.026). In multiple linear regression consumption of sweetened beverages was negatively associated with serum zinc level, and consumption of >15 g/day meat was positively associated with serum zinc level, whereas current consumption of breast milk and >15 g/day beans were positively associated with serum copper level.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe prevalence of low serum zinc concentration in the sample was high, and warrants further investigation amongst vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "To address the obesity epidemic, the public health community must develop surveillance systems that capture data at levels through which obesity prevention efforts are conducted. Current systems assess body mass index (BMI), diet, and physical activity behaviors at the individual level, but environmental and policy-related data are often lacking. The goal of this review is to describe US surveillance systems that evaluate obesity prevention efforts within the context of international trends in obesity monitoring, to identify potential data gaps, and to present recommendations to improve the evaluation of population-level initiatives. Our recommendations include adding environmental and policy measures to surveillance efforts with a focus on addressing underserved populations, harmonizing existing surveillance systems, including more sensitive measures of obesity outcomes, and developing a knowledgeable workforce. In addition, the widespread use of electronic health records and new technologies that allow self-quantification of behaviors offers opportunities for innovative surveillance methods.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHousehold food insecurity is associated with health and behavior risk. Much less is known about how food insecurity is related to strategies that adults use in accessing food: how and where they shop, use of alternative food sources, and their ability to manage resources.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine how maternal behaviors, including shopping, accessing alternative sources of food, and managing resources, are related to household food security status (HHFSS).\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional study collecting survey data on HHFSS, shopping behaviors, use of alternative food sources, and managing resources obtained from low-income mothers of preschool-aged children.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nOne hundred sixty-four low-income mothers of young children (55% Hispanic) from two communities in Rhode Island.\n\n\nMEASURES\nHHFSS was measured using 10 items from the 18-item Core Food Security Module to assess adult food security. Mothers were surveyed about where, when, and how often they shopped; the strategies they use when shopping; their use of alternative sources of food, including federal, state, and local assistance; and their ability to manage their resources.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nAnalysis of variance and χ2 analyses assessed the associations between demographic variables, shopping, accessing alternative food sources, and managing resources, and HHFSS. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the associations between HHFSS and maternal demographic variables, food shopping, strategies, alternative sources of food, and ability to manage resources.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMaternal age and language spoken at home were significantly associated with HHFSS; food insecurity was 10% more likely among older mothers (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17) and 2.5 times more likely among Spanish-speaking households (compared with non-Spanish speaking [aOR 3.57, 95% CI 1.25 to 10.18]). Food insecurity was more likely among mothers reporting more informal strategies (aOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.01; P<0.05) and perceiving greater inability to manage resources (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.98; P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that low-income mothers use a variety of strategies to feed their families and that the strategies they use vary by HHFSS. Community nutrition programs and providers will need to consider these strategies when counseling families at risk for food insecurity and provide guidance to minimize the influence on healthy food choices.",

        "abstract": "The United States has achieved dramatic improvements in overall maternal and child health status, yet faces disturbingly wide variations in the health status of many population subgroups. The Surgeon General in 1980 published specific quantitative objectives to stimulate further improvements in the health of the American people by 1990. A critical step in meeting relevant objectives is the more effective use at national, state, and local levels of available data, particularly infant, perinatal, neonatal, and maternal mortality rates and the incidence of low weight births. This paper reviews variations in infant mortality rates and five current federal “categorical” programs that aim to improve maternal and child health: Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants and Children; Head Start; Maternal and Child Health; Family Planning; and Community Health Centers. Several examples are cited of effective use of data in the coordination and targeting of resources from these large public programs. Recommendations are made for enhancement of federal maternal and child health programs within current funding levels. These recommendations will be all the more relevant if the Congress enacts block grants to the states with lower total funding.",

        "abstract": "The United States has achieved dramatic improvements in overall maternal and child health status, yet faces disturbingly wide variations in the health status of many population subgroups. The Surgeon General in 1980 published specific quantitative objectives to stimulate further improvements in the health of the American people by 1990. A critical step in meeting relevant objectives is the more effective use at national, state, and local levels of available data, particularly infant, perinatal, neonatal, and maternal mortality rates and the incidence of low weight births. This paper reviews variations in infant mortality rates and five current federal “categorical” programs that aim to improve maternal and child health: Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants and Children; Head Start; Maternal and Child Health; Family Planning; and Community Health Centers. Several examples are cited of effective use of data in the coordination and targeting of resources from these large public programs. Recommendations are made for enhancement of federal maternal and child health programs within current funding levels. These recommendations will be all the more relevant if the Congress enacts block grants to the states with lower total funding.",

        "abstract": "Objective Demonstrate validity and reliability for an obesity risk assessment tool for young children targeting families' modifiable home environments. Design Longitudinal design with data collected over 100 weeks. Setting Head Start and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Participants Parent–child pairs (n = 133) provided food behavior assessments; 3 child‐modified, 24‐hour dietary recalls; 3 ≥ 36‐hour activity logs; and measured heights and weights. Main Outcome Measure Five measures of validity and 5 of reliability. Results Validity was excellent for the assessment tool, named Healthy Kids, demonstrating an inverse relationship with child body mass index percentile‐for‐age (P = .02). Scales were significantly related to hypothesized variables (P ≤ .05): fruit or vegetable cup equivalents; folate; vitamins A, C, and D; &bgr;‐carotene; calcium; fiber; sugar; screen, sleep, and physical activity minutes; and parent behaviors. Measures of reliability were acceptable. Conclusions and Implications Overall, children with higher Healthy Kids scores had a more healthful profile as well as lower body mass index percentiles‐for‐age 1.5 years later. Healthy Kids has potential for use by nutrition professionals as a screening tool to identify young children most at risk for excess weight gain, as an evaluation to assess intervention impact, and as a counseling tool to tailor intervention efforts. Future research should include validation in other settings and with other populations.",

        "abstract": "Objective. This study was conducted to assess the impact of a breastfeeding promotion clinic environment project implemented by the state of Mississippi on breastfeeding knowledge, attitudes, and practices of WIC clinic staff. Methods. Thirteen pairs of matched intervention and comparison WIC clinics participated in the study. Clinical and administrative staff completed pre-test and post-test self-administered questionnaires in 1998 and 1999. Results. A total of 397 staff members provided pre-test data, and 277 staff members provided post-test data. Before project implementation, the intervention and comparison groups were similar overall. The majority of staff had positive attitudes/beliefs about breastfeeding, but gaps in knowledge and practices were noted. Post-test data showed that the project improved knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, and confidence/practice of intervention clinic staff. Conclusions. Clinic environment projects, which combine physical improvements and staff training, are effective in promoting support for breastfeeding among public health clinic staff. Similar interventions may contribute to the overall effectiveness of breastfeeding promotion programs.",

        "abstract": "This paper uses the results from a community food security assessment survey of 684 residents and three focus groups in Pueblo County, Colorado to examine the question: what community and individual factors contribute to or alleviate food insecurity, and are these factors consistent throughout a sub-county population. Importantly, we use a technique called cluster analysis to endogenously determine the key factors pertinent to food access and fruit and vegetable consumption. Our results show significant heterogeneity among sub-population clusters in terms of the community and individual factors that would make it easier to get access to fruits and vegetables. We find two distinct clusters of food insecure populations: the first was significantly less likely to identify increased access to fruits and vegetables proximate to where they live or work as a way to improve their household’s healthy food consumption despite being significantly less likely to utilize a personal vehicle to get to the store; the second group did not report significant challenges with access, rather with affordability. We conclude that though interventions focused on improving the local food retail environment may be important for some subsamples of the food insecure population, it is unclear that proximity to a store with healthy food will support enhanced food security for all. We recommend that future research recognizes that determinants of food insecurity may vary within county or zip code level regions, and that multiple interventions that target sub-population clusters may elicit better improvements in access to and consumption of fruits and vegetables.",

        "abstract": "Policies to improve food accessibility in underserved areas often use direct financial incentives to attract new food retailers. Our analysis of data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Georgia before and after the Great Recession suggests that increased program enrollment improves access to food for SNAP beneficiaries by acting as an indirect subsidy to retailers. We divided food stores into four categories: large, midsize, small, and specialty retailers. Between 2008 and 2011 the number of SNAP enrollees increased by 87 percent, and between 2007 and 2014 the number of SNAP retailers in Georgia increased by 82 percent, primarily because of growth in the number of authorized small retailers. Inside metropolitan Atlanta, changes in the numbers of SNAP enrollees and authorized retailers were positively and significantly associated for small retailers. For the areas outside of metropolitan Atlanta, the association between changes in numbers of enrollees and authorized retailers was strongest for small retailers; more modest associations were also seen for large and specialty retailers. Policy makers should consider how retailers' sensitivity to and reliance on SNAP funding can be leveraged to improve not only food availability, but also access to healthy foods.",

        "abstract": "Atrazine, a common water contaminant in the U.S., has been associated with adverse birth outcomes in previous studies. This study aimed to determine if atrazine concentrations in drinking water are associated with adverse birth outcomes including small for gestational age (SGA), term low birth weight (term LBW), very low birth weight (VLBW), preterm birth (PTB), and very preterm birth (VPTB). This study included 14,445 live singleton births from Ohio communities served by 22 water systems enrolled in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Atrazine Monitoring Program between 2006 and 2008. Mean gestational and trimester-specific atrazine concentrations were calculated. Significantly increased odds of term LBW birth was associated with atrazine exposure over the entire gestational period (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10, 1.45), as well as the first (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08, 1.34) and second trimesters (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07, 1.20) of pregnancy. We observed no evidence of an association between atrazine exposure via drinking water and SGA, VLBW, PTB, or VPTB. Our results suggest that atrazine exposure is associated with reduced birth weight among term infants and that exposure to atrazine in drinking water in early and mid-pregnancy may be most critical for its toxic effects on the fetus.",

An NDTR's scope of practice in nutrition and dietetics has flexible boundaries to capture the depth and breadth of the individual's practice. The NDTR's practice expands with advances in many areas, including nutrition, food production, food safety, food systems management, health care, public health, community health, and information and communication technology. The Revised 2017 Scope of Practice for the NDTR reflects the position of the Academy on the essential role of the NDTR in the management and delivery of food and nutrition services. The scope of practice for the NDTR is composed of education and credentialing, practice resources, Academy Standards of Practice and Standards of Professional Performance, codes of ethics, accreditation standards, state and federal regulations, national guidelines, and organizational policy and procedures. The Revised 2017 Scope of Practice for the NDTR is used in conjunction with the Revised 2017 Standards of Practice in Nutrition Care and the Standards of Professional Performance for NDTRs. The Standards of Practice address activities related to direct patient and client care. The Standards of Professional Performance address behaviors related to the technical role of NDTRs. These standards reflect the minimum competent level of nutrition and dietetics practice and professional performance for NDTRs. A companion document addresses the scope of practice for the RDN.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Reducing harm from secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is especially critical for children. Current strategies aimed at reducing SHS exposure in workplaces and public spaces have been successful in reducing adult exposure, yet infants and children, who are greatly susceptible to the adverse health effects of SHS exposure, continue to be among the most exposed in the USA. Novel strategies are needed that can work in combination with those aimed at removing SHS exposure from children, our single highest priority. The overall aim of this monograph is to demonstrate how nutrition has the potential to ameliorate adverse SHS-related outcomes in children. This aim is accomplished by providing evidence for the following: susceptibility to SHS exposure is greatest during critical windows of lung and immune system development; dietary factors act on SHS mechanisms and have the potential to reduce the risk of related adverse outcomes; the key mechanisms of adverse SHS-related outcomes include reduced nutrient status, oxidative stress, compromised immune function, and chronic inflammation; identification of nutrition-related interventions for SHS-exposed populations is a timely issue and requires future research. Our primary aim should be to eliminate SHS exposure. Until infants and children are no longer exposed to SHS, however, we propose investigating nutrition-focused interventions as a method to reduce the risk of SHS-related health outcomes for infants and children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOver consumption of energy-dense nutrient-poor foods may contribute to childhood obesity. We hypothesized that greater than recommended servings of sugar sweetened beverages and foods, indicators of food security, and a high maternal recumbent weight-for-length are positively associated with high percentages of child overweight/obesity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis secondary data analysis consisted of a sample of 240 mother-child dyads. The original studies were designed to examine the effect of a public health nursing intervention on optimal childhood growth for low-income, minority children. Eligibility to participate included: 1) mothers self-identified as Hispanic; 2) children were 12-24 months old; and 3) children were enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC); and 4) children were free of any major disease. Multivariate logistic regression examined the association between child weight, weight-for-length, maternal recumbent weight-for-length, child's eating schedule, maternal attitudes on feeding, food security, and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts and fatty meats.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReceiving SNAP was positively associated with child weight-for-length (WL). Children whose mothers reported ever having received SNAP were 2.01 times more likely to be overweight compared to children whose mothers did not report ever having received SNAP (95% CI=1.04-3.90). Children who consumed desserts were 2.87 times more likely to be overweight compared to children who did not consume desserts (95% CI=1.19-6.88). Also, child's caloric intake was significantly associated with child WL. Children who consumed more calories were 1.00 times more likely to be overweight compared to children who consumed fewer calories (95% CI=1.00-1.00).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nResearch on food security and children's weight has reported mixed findings. Methodological issues have been identified as contributory to the inconsistent findings. Of paramount importance to these studies is the measurement of low food security.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nChildren in this sample who were food insecure, as indicated by SNAP recipients, were more likely to have a higher WL measurement. Future studies should focus on the correlation between food security and hunger/satiety cues.",

        "abstract": "Inventory requirements for authorized Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) retailers have undergone several revisions to increase the availability of healthful foods. A proposed rule of 84 staple food items was not implemented due to concerns that stores would not withstand this expansion, resulting in a final rule requiring 36 items. This study used the Food Access Research Atlas data to characterize food provisions in 30 small retailers in areas with high and low proportions of SNAP and racial minority residents in Providence, Rhode Island (RI). Stores were assessed with an audit instrument to tally variety, perishability, and depth of stock of four staple food categories. Descriptive, analysis of variance, and chi-square analyses were performed. Across stores, 80% were compliant with the final rule, but 66.7% would need to expand their offerings to meet the proposed rule. Mean dairy variety was lowest among all categories (p < 0.05). Most stores met the perishability (92.3%) and depth-of-stock requirements (96.1%) under both rules. No difference was detected between areas with high and low proportions of SNAP and racial minority residents. Future expansion of requirements may increase healthful food availability without imposing undue burdens on retailers in Providence, RI, excluding increased requirements for dairy variety.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine public attitudes towards federal spending on nutrition assistance programmes and support for policies to improve the nutritional impact of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\n\nDESIGN\nParticipants answered survey questions by telephone assessing support for SNAP spending and proposed programme policy changes.\n\n\nSETTING USA SUBJECTS\nSurvey of 3024 adults selected by random digit dialling conducted in April 2012, including 418 SNAP participants.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA majority (77%; 95% CI 75, 79%) of all respondents supported maintaining or increasing SNAP benefits, with higher support among Democrats (88%; 95% CI 86, 90%) than Republicans (61%; 95% CI 58, 65%). The public supported policies to improve the nutritional impact of SNAP. Eighty-two per cent (95% CI 80, 84%) of respondents supported providing additional benefits to programme participants that can only be used on healthful foods. Sixty-nine per cent (95% CI 67, 71%) of respondents supported removing SNAP benefits for sugary drinks. A majority of SNAP participants (54%; 95% CI 48, 60%) supported removing SNAP benefits for sugary drinks. Of the 46% (95% CI 40, 52%) of SNAP participants who initially opposed removing sugary drinks, 45 % (95% CI 36, 54%) supported removing SNAP benefits for sugary drinks if the policy also included additional benefits to purchase healthful foods.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe US public broadly supports increasing or maintaining spending on SNAP. The majority of respondents, including SNAP participants, supported policies to improve the nutritional impact of SNAP by restricting the purchase of sugary drinks and incentivizing purchase of healthful foods with SNAP benefits.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEnvironmental and policy influences are potentially the most powerful-and yet the least understood-strategies for reversing the current childhood obesity epidemic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis essay focuses on the school lunch environment and examines the key legal and policy factors that affect competitive foods or foods of minimal nutritional value (FMNV) in schools. The essay also analyzes the latest, proposed federal legislation on redefining competitive foods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFMNV compete for children's coins and calories in the school food environment. The emerging scientific record on the negative impact competitive foods have on children's diet and health is significantly stronger than when Congress and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) secretary first deemed the connection sufficient to take action. The Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2006, if enacted, will provide additional authority to the USDA and supply science-based federal guidance to local schools. Opposition to this legislation may come from the local school districts, the food industry, parents, and children.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDefining competitive foods in a federally consistent manner and eliminating competitive foods from our nation's schools are food fight that will evidently be fought by legislative efforts at the local, state, and federal level. The food industry, as history illustrates, will likely work hard to weaken any regulatory efforts and could potentially demand that this fight end up requiring judicial review.",

RDNs integrate research, professional development, and practice to stimulate innovation and discovery; collaborate to solve the greatest food and nutrition challenges now and in the future; focus on systemswide impact across the food, wellness, and health sectors; have a global impact in eliminating all forms of malnutrition; and amplify the contribution of nutrition and dietetics practitioners and expand workforce capacity and capability. The Revised 2017 Scope of Practice for the RDN reflects the position of the Academy on the essential role of the RDN in the direction and delivery of food and nutrition services. The scope of practice for the RDN is composed of education and credentialing, practice resources, Academy Standards of Practice and Professional Performance, codes of ethics, accreditation standards, state and federal regulations, national guidelines, and organizational policy and procedures. The Revised 2017 Scope of Practice for the RDN is used in conjunction with the Revised 2017 Standards of Practice (SOP) in Nutrition Care and the Standards of Professional Performance (SOPP) for RDNs. The SOP address activities related to direct patient and client care. The SOPP address behaviors related to the professional role of RDNs. These standards reflect the minimum competent level of nutrition and dietetics practice and professional performance for RDNs. A companion document addresses the scope of practice for the NDTR.",

        "abstract": "To the Editor, In their recent paper, Yunzal-Butler et al. [1] report an analysis of the association between the timing of enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and cigarette smoking among prenatal WIC participants. Based on the finding that women who enroll in WIC early during pregnancy experience only modestly higher quit rates than women who enroll late, Yunzal-Butler et al. conclude that there ‘‘is ample room to improve WIC’s performance,’’ suggesting the WIC program consider intensifying its role in smoking cessation, perhaps through ‘‘more frequent and more focused’’ counseling. The purpose of this letter is twofold: first, we wanted to clarify the goals and approach of WIC in an effort to better contextualize smoking cessation efforts in the program. Second, we wanted to comment on issues that were not raised or adequately discussed by the authors, namely statistical issues regarding the smoking data and covariates utilized in the analysis. WIC is the only federally sponsored public health nutrition program whose mission is ‘‘to safeguard the health of low-income women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating, and referrals to health care’’ services [2]. Contrary to popular belief, WIC is not an entitlement program. This means that available funds do not cover all eligible applicants. With the funds that are available, and the recognition that the epidemic of obesity leads to numerous poor health outcomes, the primary goal of the WIC program is to provide nutritional education, counseling and nutritious foods to supplement participants’ diets. The WIC program provides grants to states to administer the program. States, in turn, fund contracts to local agencies to deliver WIC nutrition services. The scope of services provided by WIC local agencies is broad and includes nutrition education, nutrition risk assessment, breastfeeding support and promotion, immunization screening, referrals to health care and drug and substance abuse services and programs, and promotion of good nutrition for good health, including promotion of physical activity. Participation in nutrition education is voluntary; referrals to health care and other services are offered but not enforced. The positive results presented by Yunzal-Butler et al. suggest that WIC successfully goes beyond its primary goal of improving participants’ nutritional status and education by encouraging healthier lifestyle changes, in this case impacting smoking quit rates. While the authors are correct that the quit rates are modest compared to targeted smoking cessation programs, we believe this comparison is quite inappropriate, due to the aforementioned primary goal of the WIC program as a public health nutrition and education program. Although the WIC program offers participants referrals to smoking cessation programs, it is unrealistic to expect this public health nutrition program to achieve quit rates as high as a focused tobacco cessation program.

        "abstract": "Objective. Food insecurity is defined as lack of access at all times, due to economic barriers, to enough food for an active and healthy lifestyle. The objective of this study was threefold: to characterize levels of food security, food insecurity, and hunger among migrant and seasonal Latino farmworkers; to assess predictors of food insecurity for this group; and to describe the strategies farmworkers use to cope with food insecurity. Methods. Adults from 102 farmworker households in North Carolina responded to a survey that used a Spanish-language adaptation of the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module and questions about sociodemographic characteristics and food behaviors. Twenty-five farmworkers participated in in-depth interviews in which they described their households' food security situation and coping strategies. Results. Forty-eight of the 102 sample households (47.1%) were classified as food insecure, including 10 (9.8%) with moderate hunger and five (4.9%) with severe hunger. Households with children had a significantly higher prevalence of food insecurity than those without children (56.4% vs. 36.2%). Households with children accessed food programs such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) that were unavailable to those without children, while those without children were more likely to access food pantries and to consume wild game or fish. Coping strategies included borrowing money, reducing food variety, and adults consuming less food to protect children from hunger. Food insecurity was more than four times as prevalent among farmworker households as among the general U.S. population. Conclusion. Policy changes to increase economic resources and access to federal programs are needed to decrease this food insecurity.",

Mothers preferred messages that emphasized their role as a teacher and noted benefits such as their children becoming more independent and learning new skills. Mothers commonly doubted children's ability to accurately report when they are \"full\" and disliked messages encouraging mothers to allow children to \"decide\" whether and how much to eat.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nThis study generated 7 audience-tested messages for incorporation into nutrition education interventions targeting low-income mothers of preschool-age children.",

Mothers preferred messages that emphasized their role as a teacher and noted benefits such as their children becoming more independent and learning new skills. Mothers commonly doubted children's ability to accurately report when they are \"full\" and disliked messages encouraging mothers to allow children to \"decide\" whether and how much to eat.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nThis study generated 7 audience-tested messages for incorporation into nutrition education interventions targeting low-income mothers of preschool-age children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nUS-based studies are needed to estimate the relation, if any, between diet quality and estimated diet costs.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe hypothesized that lower cost diets among low-income women in California would be energy dense but nutrient poor.\n\n\nDESIGN\nEnergy and nutrient intakes for 112 women aged 18-45 y living in California were obtained with a food-frequency instrument. Dietary energy density (in MJ/kg or kcal/g) and energy-adjusted diet costs (in $/10 MJ or $/2000 kcal) were calculated with local food prices. Tertile splits of energy density and energy cost were analyzed with one-factor analysis of variance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean daily energy intake excluding all beverages was 7.1 MJ (1699 kcal), and mean dietary energy density was 6.5 kJ/kg (1.54 kcal/g). Lower dietary energy density was associated with significantly higher intakes of dietary fiber (P = 0.004), vitamin A (P < 0.001), and vitamin C (P < 0.001) and with significantly lower intakes of total fat (P = 0.003) and saturated fat (P < 0.001). Higher diet cost was associated with significantly lower dietary energy density (P < 0.001), total fat (P = 0.024), and saturated fat (P = 0.025) and with significantly higher intakes of vitamins A (P = 0.003) and C (P < 0.001). Each additional dollar in estimated diet costs was associated with a drop in energy density of 0.94 MJ/kg (0.225 kcal/g).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe finding that higher quality diets were more costly for these low-income women has implications for the food assistance and education programs of the US Department of Agriculture. Policy interventions may be required to allow low-income families in the United States to improve the quality of their diets given their food budget constraints.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity and hunger are real and growing problems in the United States. Among older adults, the prevalence of food insecurity is at a 14-year high and occurred in more than 8% of households with older adults in 2008 according to USDA. However, the rate is at least 10% higher when less severe degrees of food insecurity are considered. Emerging research suggests that several segments of the older adult population are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity, including those receiving or requesting congregate meals, home-delivered meals, and other community-based services. Thus, national and state estimates of food insecurity may obscure problems in specific subgroups of older adults. Older adults are at high risk of chronic health problems that can be exacerbated by food insecurity, poor nutritional status, and low physical activity. To help improve targeting of food and nutrition programs to those most in need because of food insecurity and/or nutrition-related chronic health problems, the purposes of this review are (1) to define the prevalence and consequences of food insecurity; (2) to discuss the outcomes of some food, nutrition, disease prevention, and health promotion programs targeted to older adults in Georgia, the state with the 3rd highest prevalence of food insecurity; and (3) to make recommendations for research, service, and advocacy related to monitoring and alleviating food insecurity and related health problems in older adults.",

        "abstract": "Given the federal cost-containment policy to rebalance long-term care away from nursing homes to home- and community-based services, it is the position of the American Dietetic Association, the American Society for Nutrition, and the Society for Nutrition Education that all older adults should have access to food and nutrition programs that ensure the availability of safe, adequate food to promote optimal nutritional status. Appropriate food and nutrition programs include adequately funded food assistance and meal programs, nutrition education, screening, assessment, counseling, therapy, monitoring, evaluation, and outcomes documentation to ensure more healthful aging. The growing number of older adults, the health care focus on prevention, and the global economic situation accentuate the fundamental need for these programs. Yet far too often food and nutrition programs are disregarded or taken for granted. Growing older generally increases nutritional risk. Illnesses and chronic diseases; physical, cognitive, and social challenges; racial, ethnic, and linguistic differences; and low socioeconomic status can further complicate a situation. The beneficial effects of nutrition for health promotion, risk reduction, and disease management need emphasis. Although many older adults are enjoying longer and more healthful lives in their own homes, others, especially those with health disparities and poor nutritional status, would benefit from greater access to food and nutrition programs and services. Food and nutrition practitioners can play a major role in promoting universal access and integrating food and nutrition programs and nutrition services into home- and community-based services.",

Ethnicity/race may influence the strategies parents use to reduce the effects of food insecurity. The purpose of this review is to compare coping strategies for food insecurity used by parents of different ethnicities/race as reported in published literature. A systematic search on PubMed and Embase yielded 983 studies, of which 13 studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. All groups used public and private assistance, social networks, nutrition related, and financial-related strategies. The limited evidence suggests that there are differences in how parents of different ethnicities/race apply these coping strategies. Current evidence is insufficient to confidently determine the extent of these differences. This review is a starting point for exploration of cultural differences in how parents of various ethnicities/race cope with food insecurity and identifies specific areas for further research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nAcademic primary care clinics often care for children from underserved populations affected by food insecurity. Clinical-community collaborations could help mitigate such risk. We sought to design, implement, refine, and evaluate Keeping Infants Nourished and Developing (KIND), a collaborative intervention focused on food-insecure families with infants.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPediatricians and community collaborators codeveloped processes to link food-insecure families with infants to supplementary infant formula, educational materials, and clinic and community resources. Intervention evaluation was done prospectively by using time-series analysis and descriptive statistics to characterize and enumerate those served by KIND during its first 2 years. Analyses assessed demographic, clinical, and social risk outcomes, including completion of preventive services and referral to social work or our medical-legal partnership. Comparisons were made between those receiving and not receiving KIND by using χ2 statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the 2-year study period, 1042 families with infants received KIND. Recipients were more likely than nonrecipients to have completed a lead test and developmental screen (both P < .001), and they were more likely to have received a full set of well-infant visits by 14 months (42.0% vs. 28.7%; P < .0001). Those receiving KIND also were significantly more likely to have been referred to social work (29.2% vs. 17.6%; P < .0001) or the medical-legal partnership (14.8% vs. 5.7%; P < .0001). Weight-for-length at 9 months did not statistically differ between groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA clinical-community collaborative enabled pediatric providers to address influential social determinants of health. This food insecurity-focused intervention was associated with improved preventive care outcomes for the infants served.",

        "abstract": "While neighborhood environments are increasingly recognized as important contributors to obesity risk, less has been reported on the socio-cultural aspects of neighborhoods that influence obesity development. This is especially true among immigrants, who may lack the necessary language skills to navigate their new living environments. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that young children of immigrants would be at lower obesity risk if they lived in neighborhoods where neighbors share the same language and culture. Using 2000 Census data and 2003-2009 data from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children in Los Angeles County, we examined the relation between BMI z-scores in low-income children aged 2-5 years (N = 250,029) and the concentration of neighborhood residents who spoke the same language as the children's mothers. Using multi-level modeling and adjusting for child's gender and race/ethnicity, household education, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and year the child was examined, we found that percent of neighborhood residents who spoke the same language as the child's mother was negatively associated with BMI z-scores. This relation varied by child's race/ethnicity and mother's preferred language. The relation was linear and negative among children of English-speaking Hispanic mothers and Chinese-speaking mothers. However, for Hispanic children of Spanish-speaking mothers the relation was curvilinear, initially exhibiting a positive relation which reversed at higher neighborhood concentrations of Spanish-speaking residents. Our findings suggest that living in neighborhoods where residents share the same language may influence obesity-related behaviors (namely diet and physical activity) possibly through mechanisms involving social networks, support, and norms.",

        "abstract": "Immigrant health assimilation is often framed as a linear, individualistic process. Yet new assimilation theory and structural theories of health behavior imply variation in health assimilation as immigrants and their families interact with different US social institutions throughout the day. We test this idea by analyzing how two indicators of dietary assimilation-food acculturation and healthy eating-vary throughout the day as Mexican children in immigrant households consume food in different institutional settings. Using individual fixed-effects models and data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we find that Mexican children in immigrant households (N = 2,337) engage in \"dietary code-switching,\" eating more acculturated but not necessarily less healthy food in schools and more acculturated but less healthy food in restaurants compared to homes. Findings advance theory and knowledge about how social institutions condition dietary assimilation in particular and health assimilation more broadly.",

        "abstract": "Declining health and food security status among low-income immigrants in the U.S. may result from limited access to healthful, cultural foods and safety net programs. We held focus group discussions with low-income Cambodian and Brazilian immigrants (11 groups, n = 84) living in Massachusetts. Cambodians and Brazilians valued healthful, cultural foods, emphasizing their beliefs that cultural foods are healthier and beneficial for weight management and aging. Although both groups could access these foods, some individuals had difficulty affording them. Cambodians reported that food quality decreased over the month due to inadequate resources. Cambodians relied on SNAP, WIC, families, and food pantries; however, Brazilians generally did not participate in safety net programs. Barriers to accessing and using safety nets appear to limit diet quality for some immigrant families. Targeted nutrition interventions should build on current knowledge of and desire for healthful, cultural foods in the context of available safety nets.",

        "abstract": "This study measured food security and hunger of households involved in Head Start in a rural Appalachian county and assessed factors that could affect food security and hunger. A convenience sample of households with children enrolled in the Head Start program in Athens County, Ohio, were sampled (n=710), with adults from 297 (42%) households responding. The survey instrument included the 18-question US Household Food Security Survey Module for measuring hunger and food insecurity. Of those responding, 152 households (51.2%) were food secure and 145 (48.8%) were food insecure. Ninety (30.3%) had experienced hunger in the previous 12 months, and 41 (13.8%) households were classified as food insecure with childhood hunger. Hunger was related to a variety of household characteristics and associated with several factors, including participation in food banks, dependence on family members and friends outside of the household for food, lacking reliable transportation, and not having a garden.",

        "abstract": "Where households across income levels shop for food is of central concern within a growing body of research focused on where people live relative to where they shop, what they purchase and eat, and how those choices influence the risk of obesity and chronic disease. We analyzed data from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) using a conditional logit model to determine where participants shop for food to be prepared and eaten at home and how individual and household characteristics of food shoppers interact with store characteristics and distance from home in determining store choice. Store size, whether or not it was a full-service supermarket, and the driving distance from home to the store constituted the three significant main effects on store choice. Overall, participants were more likely to choose larger stores, conventional supermarkets rather than super-centers and other types of stores, and stores closer to home. Interaction effects show that participants receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) were even more likely to choose larger stores. Hispanic participants were more likely than non-Hispanics to choose full-service supermarkets while White participants were more likely to travel further than non-Whites. This study demonstrates the value of explicitly spatial discrete choice models and provides evidence of national trends consistent with previous smaller, local studies.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity rates have risen significantly in the United States beginning with the recent recession and remained high. The implications of these high rates are severe in that food insecurity has been associated with a wide range of health, behavioral, social and cognitive difficulties. This paper examines the relationship between the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and food insecurity outcomes. The SBP has the potential to reduce food insecurity because of the direct provision of breakfast to students and the implied income transfer to households. We use state-level cutoffs tied to school-level poverty rates that mandate the provision of the SBP to compare the food security outcomes of students in similar schools, but with different requirements to provide breakfast. Our estimates suggest that state policies requiring schools to offer the SBP have reduced food insecurity for young children.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nMore than 42 million people in the United States are food insecure. Although some health care entities are addressing food insecurity among patients because of associations with disease risk and management, little is known about the components of these initiatives.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Systematic Screening and Assessment Method was used to conduct a landscape assessment of US health care entity-based programs that screen patients for food insecurity and connect them with food resources. A network of food insecurity researchers, experts, and practitioners identified 57 programs, 22 of which met the inclusion criteria of being health care entities that 1) screen patients for food insecurity, 2) link patients to food resources, and 3) target patients including adults aged 50 years or older (a focus of this assessment). Data on key features of each program were abstracted from documentation and telephone interviews.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost programs (n = 13) focus on patients with chronic disease, and most (n = 12) partner with food banks. Common interventions include referrals to or a list of food resources (n = 19), case managers who navigate patients to resources (n = 15), assistance with federal benefit applications (n = 14), patient education and skill building (n = 13), and distribution of fruit and vegetable vouchers redeemable at farmers markets (n = 8). Most programs (n = 14) routinely screen all patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe programs reviewed use various strategies to screen patients, including older adults, for food insecurity and to connect them to food resources. Research is needed on program effectiveness in improving patient outcomes. Such evidence can be used to inform the investments of potential stakeholders, including health care entities, community organizations, and insurers.",

This study uses data from two national birth cohort studies in the U.S., the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (N = ∼9400) from 2001 to 2003 and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 2458) from 1998 to 2003, to estimate the effects of poor infant health on child and household food insecurity and explore the potential buffering effects of public programs that provide food, healthcare, and cash assistance. We address the issue of causality by defining poor infant health as an unexpected shock and conducting relevant specification tests. We find convincing evidence that poor infant health does not affect food insecurity but that it greatly increases reliance on cash assistance for low-income individuals with disabilities, which appears to be playing a buffering role.",

        "abstract": "Given the federal cost-containment policy to rebalance long-term care away from nursing homes to home- and community-based services, it is the position of the American Dietetic Association, the American Society for Nutrition, and the Society for Nutrition Education that all older adults should have access to food and nutrition programs that ensure the availability of safe, adequate food to promote optimal nutritional status. Appropriate food and nutrition programs include adequately funded food assistance and meal programs, nutrition education, screening, assessment, counseling, therapy, monitoring, evaluation, and outcomes documentation to ensure more healthful aging. The growing number of older adults, the health care focus on prevention, and the global economic situation accentuate the fundamental need for these programs. Yet far too often food and nutrition programs are disregarded or taken for granted. Growing older generally increases nutritional risk. Illnesses and chronic diseases; physical, cognitive, and social challenges; racial, ethnic, and linguistic differences; and low socioeconomic status can further complicate a situation. The beneficial effects of nutrition for health promotion, risk reduction, and disease management need emphasis. Although many older adults are enjoying longer and more healthful lives in their own homes, others, especially those with health disparities and poor nutritional status, would benefit from greater access to food and nutrition programs and services. Food and nutrition practitioners can play a major role in promoting universal access and integrating food and nutrition programs and nutrition services into home- and community-based services.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that systematic and sustained action is needed to bring an end to domestic food insecurity and hunger and to achieve food and nutrition security for all in the United States. The Association believes that immediate and long-range interventions are needed, including adequate funding for and increased utilization of food and nutrition assistance programs, the inclusion of food and nutrition education in all programs providing food and nutrition assistance, and innovative programs to promote and support the economic self-sufficiency of individuals and families, to end food insecurity and hunger in the United States. Food insecurity continues to exist in the United States, with over 38 million people experiencing it sometime in 2004. Negative nutritional and nonnutritional outcomes have been associated with food insecurity in adults, adolescents, and children, including poor dietary intake and nutritional status, poor health, increased risk for the development of chronic diseases, poor psychological and cognitive functioning, and substandard academic achievement. Dietetics professionals can play a key role in ending food insecurity and hunger and are uniquely positioned to make valuable contributions through provision of comprehensive food and nutrition education, competent and collaborative practice, innovative research related to accessing a safe and secure food supply, and advocacy efforts at the local, state, regional, and national levels.",

Characteristically, it was like another scene from \"the Perils of Pauline\" in the history of this adventure-filled program. The Office of Management and Budget was urging the President to veto the bill and it seems that only the last-minute intervention by a coalition of groups interested in child nutrition saved the day for WIC by urging the President to sign the bill. The history of the WIC program began in the late 1960s. Between 1968 to 1970, three studies of the nutritional status of the poor in this country were done. 1-3 The findings of all three of these studies were similar.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the effect of a community-based lifestyle behavioral intervention on intakes of fat, fruits, vegetables, fast foods, and beverages in low-income young mothers with overweight or obesity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants were randomly assigned to an intervention (watching video lessons at home plus peer support group teleconferences) or a comparison group. General linear mixed model analyses were utilized to determine mean differences between the groups (212 intervention, 126 comparison) immediately following and 3 months (196 intervention, 115 comparison) after the intervention.\n\n\nRESULTS\nImmediately after the intervention, the intervention group had significantly lower mean scores in intakes of fat (effect size [d] = 0.24), fast foods (d = 0.33), and non-sugar-sweetened beverages (d = 0.27) than the comparison group. No significant group differences were observed for intakes of fruits, vegetables, or sugar-sweetened beverages. Three months after the intervention, no significant group differences were observed for intakes of fat, fruits, vegetables, fast foods, and both sugar- and non-sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe intervention group improved dietary intakes of fat and fast foods but not fruits, vegetables, or beverages over the short term. Our intervention had no long-term effect on dietary intake behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Investing in strategies that aim to build a more nurturing society offers tremendous opportunities for the field of prevention science. Yet, scientists struggle to consistently take their research beyond effectiveness evaluations and actually value the impact of preventive strategies. Ultimately, it is clear that convincing policymakers to make meaningful investments in children and youth will require estimates of the fiscal impact of such strategies across public service systems. The framework offered here values such investments. First, we review current public spending on children and families. Then, we describe how to quantify and monetize the impact of preventive interventions. This includes a new measurement strategy for assessing multisystem service utilization and a price list for key service provision from public education, social services, criminal justice, health care and tax systems.",

        "abstract": "Few studies take into account the influence of family size on household resources when assessing income disparities in fruit and vegetable (F/V) consumption. Poverty income ratio (PIR) is a measure that utilizes both reported income and household size. We sought to examine state-specific disparities in meeting Healthy People 2010 objectives for F/V consumption by percent PIR. This analysis included 353,005 adults in 54 states and territories reporting data to the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in the United States. Percent PIR was calculated using the midpoint of self-reported income range and family size. The prevalences consuming at least two fruits and at least three vegetables per day were examined by percent PIR (<130% [greatest poverty], 130% to <200%, 200% to <400%, and ≥ 400% [least poverty]). The percent of adults consuming vegetables at least three times daily was significantly lower (21.3%) among those living at greatest poverty (<130% PIR) compared with 30.7% among those with least poverty (≥ 400% PIR). Daily consumption of vegetables at least three times was significantly lower among those with greatest poverty in a majority of states and territories surveyed (43 of 54). The overall percent of adults consuming fruits at least 2 times daily was also lower among those living at greatest vs least poverty, but the difference was smaller (32.0% vs 34.2%), with 14 states reporting a difference that was significantly lower among those with greatest poverty. Our study revealed that in 2009 a significantly lower proportion of US adults living at greatest poverty consumed fruits at least two times daily or vegetables at least three times daily compared with those with the least poverty, with greater disparity in vegetable intake. Policy and environmental strategies for increased affordability, access, availability, and point-of-decision information are approaches that may help disparate households purchase and consume F/V.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity is associated with increased risk of diet-related disease. A key initiative of the Oregon Food Bank is to improve nutritional quality of emergency foods. The purpose of this study was to categorize products distributed by the Oregon Food Bank into food groups by pounds (as-purchased) and MyPyramid units (edible portion). Using a \"MyPyramid Day\" to describe the number of units required daily from each food group for a 2,000-kcal/day reference diet, we calculated the number of MyPyramid Days distributed in 1 year (2004-2005) by the Oregon Food Bank. Of the 36.4 million pounds of food analyzed, 24.2 million (66%) fell into MyPyramid (grains, fruit, vegetables, meat/beans, and milk), with the remaining categorized as condiments/baking supplies (2.48 M, 7%), discretionary calories (2.91 M, 8%), combination foods (2.87 M, 8%), and variety/unknown (3.96 M, 11%). Fewer MyPyramid Days were distributed (in millions of MyPyramid Days) from the fruit (5.85 M) and milk (5.95 M) groups than were foods from the grains (10.02 M), meat/beans (9.99 M), and vegetables (10.25 M) groups. A MyPyramid Day is useful for measuring distribution of foods from MyPyramid food groups. However, the utility of these results depends on whether a food assistance network has the capacity to improve quality through increased distribution of foods (either from donations or purchases) from specific food groups. Results can be used to identify foods to target for increase in food resource development efforts to improve the overall nutritional quality of foods provided to recipients.",

        "abstract": "Growth stunting is a complex phenomenon related to undernutrition that can contribute to developmental delay, cognitive deficits, and small size and obesity in adulthood. Stunted growth, defined as height for age below the 5th percentile, is primarily caused by chronic malnutrition. In this study, a community-based intervention to reduce undernutrition was tested in a quasi-experimental design with 174 low-income, Mexican-American mothers and children recruited from a Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinic in a major southwestern city. The intervention was based on the public health nursing practice of collaborating with mothers of young children on appropriate nutrition and parenting, and was tailored by the author and community informants for mothers of children with stunted growth. Data were collected on child height and weight, dietary intake, maternal acculturation, maternal perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), home environment as measured by the home screening questionnaire (HSQ), and maternal-child interaction as measured by the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS). Intervention children had higher growth velocity than the children in the comparison group. These findings were especially prominent for children of women who were older and less acculturated. Results suggest that a nursing intervention delivered in collaboration with WIC can make a significant improvement in growth of low-income children with growth stunting.",

        "abstract": "We examined the effectiveness of a peer counseling breastfeeding support program for low income women in Michigan who participate in WIC. Because there was more demand for services than could be met by the program, many women who requested services were not subsequently contacted by a peer counselor. We used a quasi-experimental methodology that utilized this excess demand for services to estimate the causal effect of the support program on several breastfeeding outcomes. We relied on data derived from administrative and survey-based sources. After providing affirmative evidence that our key assumption is consistent with the data, we estimated that the program caused the breastfeeding initiation to increase by about 27 percentage points and the mean duration of breastfeeding to increase by more than 3 weeks. The support program we evaluated was very effective at increasing breastfeeding among low income women who participate in WIC, a population that nationally breastfeeds at rates well below the national average and below what is recommended by public health professionals. Given the substantial evidence that breastfeeding is beneficial for both the child and mother, the peer counseling breastfeeding support program should be subjected to a cost/benefit analysis and evaluated at other locales.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSuboptimal diet quality, prevalent among postpartum women, is troubling for mothers and their children because positive relationships between maternal and child diet quality exist.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe primary objective was to determine whether postnatal diet quality scores of participants in the two treatment arms differed or changed over time.\n\n\nDESIGN\nDelta Healthy Sprouts was a two-arm, randomized, controlled, comparative impact trial.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS AND SETTING\nPregnant women at least 18 years of age, less than 19 weeks pregnant, and residing in three Mississippi counties were recruited between March 2013 and December 2014. Postnatal data was collected from 54 participants between September 2013 and May 2016. The postnatal attrition rates were 17% and 13% for the control and experimental arms.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nThe control arm received the Parents as Teachers curriculum, and the experimental arm received a nutrition- and physical activity-enhanced Parents as Teachers curriculum.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nMultiple-pass 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from participants at the postnatal month 1, 4, 6, 8, and 12 visits. Healthy Eating Index-2010 was used to calculate diet quality.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED\nLinear mixed models were used to test for treatment, time, and treatment by time (interaction) effects on postnatal dietary outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nControl arm mean (95% confidence limits) total Healthy Eating Index-2010 scores were 36.8 (range=32.5 to 41.1), 36.5 (range=31.9 to 41.1), 40.2 (range=35.7 to 44.8), 39.3 (range=34.7 to 43.9), and 36.4 (range=31.8 to 41.0) at postnatal months 1, 4, 6, 8, and 12, respectively. Corresponding experimental arm scores were 42.3 (range=37.5 to 47.0), 41.6 (range=36.3 to 46.9), 40.2 (range=34.8 to 45.7), 45.8 (range=40.5 to 51.1), and 37.6 (range=32.6 to 42.7), respectively. Experimental scores were significantly higher than control scores across time. No other effects were significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNeither the standard Parents as Teachers curriculum nor the enhanced Parents as Teachers curriculum was effective at improving the poor diet quality of this cohort of rural, Southern, African-American women during the 12 months following the birth of their infant.",

        "abstract": "&NA; The effects of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on obesity have been the focus of much debate. However, causal interpretation of estimates from previous studies, comparing participants to non‐participants, is complicated by endogeneity and possible misreporting of participation in SNAP. In this paper, we take a novel approach to examine quasi‐experimental variation in SNAP benefit amount on adult obesity. Children of SNAP households qualify for free in‐school meals, thus freeing some additional benefits for the household. A greater proportion of school‐age children eligible for free in‐school meals proxies for an exogenous increase in the amount of SNAP benefits available per adult. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth‐1979 we show that school meals represent a non‐trivial part of the food budget for SNAP households. We find that increases in SNAP benefits have no effect on obesity levels for the full sample of those who report SNAP participation. To better isolate the effects of additional benefits from other potential changes we restrict our analysis to adults living in households with at least one child under 5 years of age. In this setting, we find that additional SNAP benefits reduce BMI and the probability of being obese for SNAP adults. Specifically, when one child in a household of four becomes school‐aged, adult BMI is expected to decrease by 0.23 units and the probability of being obese decreases by 2.58 percentage points or by about 10%.",

        "abstract": "Preterm birth (infants born at <37 wk of gestational age) is a significant clinical and public health challenge in the United States and globally. No universally accepted practice guidelines exist for the nutritional care of preterm infants. To address the current state of knowledge and to support systematic reviews that will be used to develop evidence-informed guidance, a consortium consisting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the ASN, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the Food and Drug Administration, the CDC, the USDA/Agricultural Research Service (USDA/ARS), and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/NIH initiated the Pre-B Project. The project included the constitution of 4 thematic working groups charged with the following tasks: 1) develop a series of topics/questions for which there is sufficient evidence to support a systematic review process to be conducted by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Evidence Analysis Library (EAL), leading to the development of new guidelines for nutritional care of preterm infants, and 2) develop a targeted research agenda to address priority gaps in our understanding of the role of nutrition in the health and development of preterm/neonatal intensive care unit infants. This review consists of a project overview including a summary of a workshop hosted by the USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center and summary reports of the 4 working groups established to address the following themes: 1) nutrient specifications, 2) clinical/practical issues in enteral feeding, 3) gastrointestinal and surgical issues, and 4) current standards for assessing infant feeding outcomes. These reports will serve as the basis for the ultimate guideline development process to be conducted by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' EAL.",

        "abstract": "We examined the effectiveness of a peer counseling breastfeeding support program for low income women in Michigan who participate in WIC. Because there was more demand for services than could be met by the program, many women who requested services were not subsequently contacted by a peer counselor. We used a quasi-experimental methodology that utilized this excess demand for services to estimate the causal effect of the support program on several breastfeeding outcomes. We relied on data derived from administrative and survey-based sources. After providing affirmative evidence that our key assumption is consistent with the data, we estimated that the program caused the breastfeeding initiation to increase by about 27 percentage points and the mean duration of breastfeeding to increase by more than 3 weeks. The support program we evaluated was very effective at increasing breastfeeding among low income women who participate in WIC, a population that nationally breastfeeds at rates well below the national average and below what is recommended by public health professionals. Given the substantial evidence that breastfeeding is beneficial for both the child and mother, the peer counseling breastfeeding support program should be subjected to a cost/benefit analysis and evaluated at other locales.",

        "abstract": "As an essen tial sup ple men tary feed ing pro gram in the United States, the suc cesses of the Sup ple men tal Nutri tion Pro gram for Women, Infants and Chil dren (WIC) over the past 25 years are many and are well docu mented. Par tici pa tion in the WIC pro gram has been asso ci ated with a reduced inci dence of low birth weight, reduc tions in fetal mor tal ity and increased head sizes of par tici pat ing WIC infants, sig nifi cant increases in birth weight, longer preg nan cies and fewer pre ma ture births, and decreased preva lence of ane mia among lowincome chil dren. It has also been esti mated that for every dol lar spent on WIC for preg nant women, $4.21 is saved in Medi caid costs. The value of the WIC pro gram, in terms of improve ments in pub lic health indi ca tors for this tar get popu la tion of lowincome, preg nant, and lac tat ing women and their chil dren, has not been matched by any other social pro gram. How ever, the impact of the WIC pro gram on the ini tia tion and dura tion of breast feed ing has been mini mal. There is a grow ing con cern among many pub lic health pro fes sion als that lower socio eco nomic groups have a lower inci dence and dura tion of breast feed ing than do higher socio eco nomic groups. Using the WIC defi ni tion of breast feed ing as “an aver age of at least once a day,” approxi mately 56% of WIC cli ents report breast feed ing at birth, accord ing to the WIC Infant Feed ing Prac tices Sur vey. This is 5.5 per cent age points higher than the rate reported nation ally for WIC par tici pants in the 1997 Ross Labo ra to ries Mother’s Sur vey. The WIC sur vey num bers drop sub stan tially at hos pi tal dis charge to 45% still breast feed ing, with con sid er able vari abil ity noted among eth nic groups. Afri can Ameri cans were least likely and His pan ics most likely to breast feed. By the end of 2 months, only 28% of those who ini ti ated breast feed ing con tinue to breast feed. The 1997 Ross Labo ra to ries Mother’s Sur vey reports 16.5% of WIC moth ers breast feed ing at 6 months and 10.6% breast feed ing at 12 months. Con trast these rates with those reported for nonWIC par tici pants for breast feed ing ini tia tion, breast feed ing at 6 months, and breast feed ing at 12 months of age at 73.4%, 35.5%, and 18.1%, respec tively. To be fair, the WIC pro gram has taken more steps in recent years to pro mote breast feed ing, and there have been mod est increases in the inci dence of breast feed ing ini tia tion and dura tion. The 1989 Child Nutri tion and WIC Reau thori za tion Act insti tuted sev eral new breast feed ing pro mo tion require ments includ ing (1) estab lish ing stan dards for breast feed ing pro mo tion and sup port, (2) requir ing states to spend a spe cific amount of money on breast feed ing pro mo tion, (3) author iz ing the pur chase of breast feed ing aids, and (4) des ig nat ing a breast feed ing coor di na tor for each state. Since 1992, WIC has also offered an enhanced food pack age to women who do not receive for mula, for up to 1 year post par tum. Breast feed ing is strongly sup ported by WIC staff, and breast feed ing edu ca tion is now pro vided",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that all Americans aged 60 years and older receive appropriate nutrition care; have access to coordinated, comprehensive food and nutrition services; and receive the benefits of ongoing research to identify the most effective food and nutrition programs, interventions, and therapies. Health, physiologic, and functional changes associated with the aging process can influence nutrition needs and nutrient intake. The practice of nutrition for older adults is no longer limited to those who are frail, malnourished, and ill. The population of adults older than age 60 years includes many individuals who are living healthy, vital lives with a variety of nutrition-related circumstances and environments. Access and availability of wholesome, nutritious food is essential to ensure successful aging and well-being for the rapidly growing, heterogeneous, multiracial, and ethnic population of older adults. To ensure successful aging and minimize the effects of disease and disability, a wide range of flexible dietary recommendations, culturally sensitive food and nutrition services, physical activities, and supportive care tailored to older adults are necessary. National, state, and local strategies that promote access to coordinated food and nutrition services are essential to maintain independence, functional ability, disease management, and quality of life. Those working with older adults must be proactive in demonstrating the value of comprehensive food and nutrition services. To meet the needs of all older adults, registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, must widen their scope of practice to include prevention, treatment, and maintenance of health and quality of life into old age.",

        "abstract": "The rate of low birth weight (LBW) is a national concern. In New York counties in 2009, the LBW rate was 8.2%. Reducing LBW has significant humanitarian and economic implications. At an average cost of $51,600 per infant, care for infants weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth is substantial. The purpose of this study was to identify demographic, socioeconomic, and health service factors that contribute to LBW among counties in New York. Analyses of data indicated that the number of MOMs providers and teen pregnancy rate were the strongest predictors for LBW. These findings reinforce the fact that LBW is a correctable phenomenon that can be addressed through public policy. With increasing budget cuts, provision of health services and implementation of programs that address teen pregnancy have become challenging. Public policy decisions and stewardship that support programs that increase the number of providers for the uninsured, underinsured, and economic underclass and maintain programs for the pregnant adolescent will help New York counties in their fight against LBW.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) in low-income households that participated in a cost-offset (CO), or 50% subsidized, community-supported agriculture (CSA) program. CSA customers paid farms upfront for a share of the harvest, and received produce weekly throughout the growing season. A cohort of adults and children 2-12 y in a summer CO-CSA were surveyed online twice: August 2015 (n = 41) and February 2016 (n = 23). FVI was measured by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Fruit and Vegetable Screener (FVS) and an inventory of locally grown fruits and vegetables. FVI relative to United States (US) recommendations and averages, and across seasons, were tested with non-parametric tests and paired t-tests (p < 0.05). Both adults and children in the CO-CSA had higher FVI than the US averages, and more often met recommendations for vegetables. Some summer fruits and vegetables were more often eaten when locally in-season. The CO-CSA model warrants further examination as an avenue for improving vegetable consumption among adults and children in low-income households. However, causality between CO-CSA participation and FVI cannot be inferred, as CO-CSA participants may be positive deviants with respect to FVI. A multi-state randomized controlled trial is currently underway to evaluate impacts of CO-CSAs on FVI and related outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCurrent U.S. guidelines recommend consideration of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for pregnant smokers if behavioral therapies fail, only under close supervision of a provider, and after discussion of known risks of continued smoking and possible risks of NRT. The percentage of pregnant smokers offered NRT by their prenatal care providers is unknown.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThe study aims to calculate the percentage of pregnant smokers offered cessation intervention and NRT and assess independent associations between selected maternal characteristics and being offered NRT.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were analyzed from the 2009-2010 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System from four states that asked about provider practices for prenatal smoking cessation. Adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated to examine associations between being offered NRT, selected maternal characteristics, and smoking level. Variables used in adjusted models were based on factors associated with smoking cessation during pregnancy from prior literature and included race, age, education, insurance type, and stress.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 3559 women who smoked 3months before pregnancy, 77.4% (95% CI: 74.2, 80.3) of 3rd trimester smokers and 42% (95% CI: 38.5, 46.4) of women who quit smoking during pregnancy were offered at least one cessation method. Among smokers, 19.1% (95% CI: 16.5, 22.1) were offered NRT and of these, almost all (94%) were offered another cessation method.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOne in five pregnant smokers was offered NRT. About a quarter of pregnant smokers did not receive any interventions to stop smoking. There may still be reluctance to provide NRT to pregnant women, despite known harms of continued smoking during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Longitudinal studies of food insecurity have not considered the unique circumstances of rural families. This study identified factors predictive of discontinuous and persistent food insecurity over three years among low-income families with children in rural counties in 13 U.S. states. Respondents reported substantial knowledge of community resources, food and finance skills, and use of formal public food assistance, yet 24% had persistent food insecurity, and another 41% were food insecure for one or two years. Multivariate multinomial regression models tested relationships between human capital, social support, financial resources, expenses, and food insecurity. Enduring chronic health conditions increased the risk of both discontinuous and persistent food insecurity. Lasting risk for depression predicted only persistent food insecurity. Education beyond high school was the only factor found protective against persistent food insecurity. Access to quality physical and mental health care services are essential to ameliorate persistent food insecurity among rural, low-income families.",

        "abstract": "Mary Story, Karen Kaphingst, and Simone French argue that U.S. schools offer many opportunities for developing obesity-prevention strategies by providing more nutritious food, offering greater opportunities for physical activity, and providing obesity-related health services.  Meals at school are available both through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's school breakfast and lunch programs and through \"competitive foods\" sold à la carte in cafeterias, vending machines, and snack bars. School breakfasts and school lunches must meet federal nutrition standards, but competitive foods are exempt from such requirements. And budget pressures force schools to sell the popular but nutritionally poor foods à la carte. Public discomfort with the school food environment is growing. But can schools provide more healthful food options without losing money? Limited evidence shows that they can.  Although federal nutrition regulations are inadequate, they permit state and local authorities to impose additional restrictions. And many are doing so. Some states limit sales of nonnutritious foods, and many large school districts restrict competitive foods.  Several interventions have changed school food environments, for example, by reducing fat content of food in vending machines and making more fruits and vegetables available. Interventions are just beginning to target the availability of competitive foods.  Other pressures can also compromise schools' efforts to encourage physical activity. As states use standardized tests to hold schools and students academically accountable, physical education and recess have become a lower priority. But some states are now mandating and promoting more physical activity in schools. School health services can also help address obesity by providing screening, health information, and referrals to students, especially low-income students, who are at high risk of obesity, tend to be underinsured, and may not receive health services elsewhere.",

        "abstract": "We examined the effectiveness of a peer counseling breastfeeding support program for low income women in Michigan who participate in WIC. Because there was more demand for services than could be met by the program, many women who requested services were not subsequently contacted by a peer counselor. We used a quasi-experimental methodology that utilized this excess demand for services to estimate the causal effect of the support program on several breastfeeding outcomes. We relied on data derived from administrative and survey-based sources. After providing affirmative evidence that our key assumption is consistent with the data, we estimated that the program caused the breastfeeding initiation to increase by about 27 percentage points and the mean duration of breastfeeding to increase by more than 3 weeks. The support program we evaluated was very effective at increasing breastfeeding among low income women who participate in WIC, a population that nationally breastfeeds at rates well below the national average and below what is recommended by public health professionals. Given the substantial evidence that breastfeeding is beneficial for both the child and mother, the peer counseling breastfeeding support program should be subjected to a cost/benefit analysis and evaluated at other locales.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLittle is known about customer purchases of foods and beverages from small and non-traditional food retailers (i.e. corner stores, gas-marts, dollar stores and pharmacies). The present study aimed to: (i) describe customer characteristics, shopping frequency and reasons for shopping at small and non-traditional food retailers; and (ii) describe food/beverage purchases and their nutritional quality, including differences across store type.\n\n\nDESIGN\nData were collected through customer intercept interviews. Nutritional quality of food/beverage purchases was analysed; a Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) score for purchases was created by aggregating participant purchases at each store.\n\n\nSETTING\nSmall and non-traditional food stores that were not WIC-authorized in Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN, USA.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nCustomers (n 661) from 105 food retailers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong participants, 29 % shopped at the store at least once daily; an additional 44 % shopped there at least once weekly. Most participants (74 %) cited convenient location as the primary draw to the store. Customers purchased a median of 2262 kJ (540 kcal), which varied by store type (P=0·04). The amount of added sugar far surpassed national dietary recommendations. At dollar stores, participants purchased a median of 5302 kJ (1266 kcal) for a median value of $US 2·89. Sugar-sweetened beverages were the most common purchase. The mean HEI-2010 score across all stores was 36·4.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSmall and non-traditional food stores contribute to the urban food environment. Given the poor nutritional quality of purchases, findings support the need for interventions that address customer decision making in these stores.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWe examined written language in Wisconsin school wellness policies (SWPs) for federal mandate compliance, quality related to obesity prevention, and school characteristics associated with variations in quality. This is the first near census of Wisconsin SWPs and examines whether adhering to federal mandates results in strong policies aimed at preventing pediatric obesity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPolicies were coded using the WellSAT 2.0. Policy quality was computed as comprehensiveness and strength based on 6 subscales and 2 overall scores. Variations in policy quality were examined by district size, free/reduced lunch percentage, and year of last revision.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe received SWPs from 91% of districts. Six of the 8 federal mandates were addressed by the majority of districts, although less than one fourth addressed all. Most comprehensiveness scores were weak to moderate, and strength scores were weak. All school characteristics were significantly related to overall policy quality; effect sizes were small.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results confirm the necessity of statewide focus on SWP improvement and suggest that while districts may be meeting federal mandates related to pediatric obesity, few policies include health promotion practices beyond those required. Policies remain fragmented and lack focus on obesity prevention practices; we identify modifiable areas for improvement.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) that exclusive breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition and health protection for the first 6 months of life, and breastfeeding with complementary foods for at least 12 months is the ideal feeding pattern for infants. Breastfeeding is also a public health strategy for improving infant and child health survival, improving maternal morbidity, controlling health care costs, and conserving natural resources. ADA emphasizes the essential role of dietetics professionals in promoting and supporting breastfeeding by providing up-to-date, practical information to pregnant and postpartum women, involving family and friends in breastfeeding education and counseling, removing institutional barriers to breastfeeding, collaborating with community organizations and others who promote and support breastfeeding, and advocating for policies that position breastfeeding as the norm for infant feeding. ADA also emphasizes its own role by providing up-to-date information to the public, encouraging empirical research, providing continuing education opportunities, providing cultural sensitivity and cultural competence training to dietetics professionals, and encouraging universities to review and update undergraduate and graduate training programs.",

        "abstract": "The purpose1 of this study is to test a model describing the relations of various biopsychosocial, behavioral, and cognitive factors on the health outcomes of nutritional adequacy and infant birth weight in low-income pregnant women. Descriptive, cohort design assessed low-income women (N=55) in their 1st trimester of pregnancy. Eighty percent of the women did not meet the recommended number of food servings outlined in the Food Guide Pyramid. Prepregnant body mass index (BMI) and pregnancy-related dietary changes explained 19% of the variance in nutritional adequacy. Maternal age, prepregnant BMI, nutritional knowledge, and infant gestation at birth explained 52% of the variance in infant birth weight. Nutritional adequacy in the 1st trimester and infant birth weight were not significantly related. Most low-income women are not meeting the nutritional requirements of pregnancy. Careful monitoring of dietary quality may help target women in need of additional nutritional education. Providing nutritional education throughout pregnancy may lead to improved dietary patterns that may reduce low birth weight.",

Results emerged from the pre-intervention formative research phase of a multi-site, multi-level obesity prevention pilot intervention on American Indian (AI) reservations. Using purposive sampling, 250 adults and children participated in qualitative research. Results reveal that having local institutional support was a key structural facilitator. 'Family connectedness' emerged as a key relational facilitator. Hegemony of systems, food deserts, transportation, and weather were key structural barriers; Childcare needs and time constraints were key relational barriers. Women's coping strategies included planning ahead, maximizing, apportioning, tempting healthy, and social support. Findings informed the development and implementation of a novel obesity prevention pilot intervention tailored for each participating AI community addressing culturally relevant messages, institutional policies, and programs. We conclude with future consideration for comparative, ethnicity-based, class-based, and gender-specific studies on women's coping strategies for household health behaviors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFood insecurity remains a public health concern in the United States, particularly among low-income urban ethnically diverse families, even with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Limited phenomenologic data exist to capture how programmatic changes to SNAP address the needs of users and why a gap in SNAP use may exist.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe primary aim of this study was to examine the experiences of low-income, Baltimore, MD, mothers in applying for and maintaining access to SNAP. Secondary aims included understanding participants' perspectives on the influence of changes in SNAP over a 3-year period and how SNAP fits into the overall system of social services for families.\n\n\nDESIGN\nIn this qualitative, phenomenologic study, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 mothers and three focus groups with 20 mothers, for a total sample of 33 mothers receiving SNAP benefits. Ten mothers participated in the first round of data collection (January to May 2010), and 23 in the second round (February to May 2013).\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nParticipants were 33 mothers receiving SNAP benefits in Baltimore City, MD.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBaltimore SNAP users' experiences with applying for and maintaining access to SNAP, as well as with program changes to the SNAP program.\n\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nData were analyzed using an iterative emergent design and phenomenologic approach. A constructivist perspective was implemented throughout the coding process.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSNAP functioned as a valuable support system within the broader social safety net for mothers living in poverty, yet participants expressed frustration about the processes of applying for and maintaining benefits due to communication problems and poor integration of services. In applying for and accessing SNAP, positive interactions with caseworkers and previous knowledge of the SNAP program were important for maintaining benefits. Interviews and focus group discussions revealed the need for additional outreach and education about the implemented program changes to build trust and improve access to SNAP among participants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImproving communication and supporting participants' ability to maintain relationships with the same caseworkers, as well as developing better integration with other aid programs, could improve the SNAP program.",

        "abstract": "The need and demand for population-level disease prevention has increased, especially with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a worldwide increase in obesity and chronic disease, and a global emphasis on preventative health care that includes behavioral, environmental, and policy interventions. In response to these evolving needs, the Public Health and Community Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group, with guidance from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Management Committee, has developed Standards of Practice and Standards of Professional Performance as tools for registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) currently in practice or interested in working in public health and community nutrition, to assess their current skill levels and to identify areas for professional development. The Standards of Practice address the four steps of the Nutrition Care Process for community and public health RDNs, which are assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and evaluation/monitoring. The Standards of Professional Performance consist of the following six domains of professional performance for community and public health RDNs: Quality in Practice, Competence and Accountability, Provision of Services, Application of Research, Communication and Application of Knowledge, and Utilization and Management of Resources. Within each standard, specific indicators provide measurable action statements that illustrate the ways in which RDNs can address client and population nutrition and health. The indicators describe three skill levels (competent, proficient, and expert) for RDNs. These tools highlight the unique scope of expertise that RDNs provide to the field of public health and community nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Immigrant Latinos face conditions which over time negatively impact their nutritional behaviors and health outcomes. Our objective was to evaluate associations between environmental and lifestyle factors and both protective dietary patterns (e.g., intake of fruits and vegetables) and harmful dietary patterns (e.g., consumption of salty snacks and fast food). Surveys were individually and orally administered to 105 foreign-born Latina mothers living in rural locations in a Midwestern state. Principal component analysis created composite variables for each construct and Spearman correlations were conducted to determine associations. Protective dietary patterns were positively associated with access to food and information (ρs = 0.21) and language acculturation (ρs = 0.24), and negatively associated with family challenges (ρs = −0.31). Food insecurity was negatively associated with harmful dietary patterns (ρs = −0.24). Findings suggest that rural Latino dietary interventions should be complemented with comprehensive strategies addressing environmental and lifestyle factors across ecological domains.",

        "abstract": "Breast milk is the gold standard for infant nutrition and the only necessary food for the first 6 months of an infant’s life. Infant formula is deficient and inferior to breast milk in meeting infants’ nutritional needs. The infant formula industry has contributed to low rates of breastfeeding through various methods of marketing and advertising infant formula. Today, in New York City, although the majority of mothers initiate breastfeeding (~85%), a minority of infants is breastfed exclusively at 8 weeks postpartum (~25%). The article reviews the practices of the formula industry and the impact of these practices. It then presents the strategic approach taken by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and its partners to change hospital practices and educate health care providers and the public on the benefits of breast milk, and provides lessons learned from these efforts to make breastfeeding the normative and usual method of infant feeding in New York City.",

        "abstract": "NHANES is the cornerstone for national nutrition monitoring to inform nutrition and health policy. Nutritional assessment in NHANES is described with a focus on dietary data collection, analysis, and uses in nutrition monitoring. NHANES has been collecting thorough data on diet, nutritional status, and chronic disease in cross-sectional surveys with nationally representative samples since the early 1970s. Continuous data collection began in 1999 with public data release in 2-y cycles on ∼10,000 participants. In 2002, the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and the NHANES dietary component were merged, forming a consolidated dietary data collection known as What We Eat in America; since then, 24-h recalls have been collected on 2 d using the USDA's Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Detailed and targeted food-frequency questionnaires have been collected in some NHANES cycles. Dietary supplement use data have been collected (in detail since 2007) so that total nutrient intakes can be described for the population. The continuous NHANES can adapt its content to address emerging public health needs and reflect federal priorities. Changes in data collection methods are made after expert input and validation/crossover studies. NHANES dietary data are used to describe intake of foods, nutrients, food groups, and dietary patterns by the US population and large sociodemographic groups to plan and evaluate nutrition programs and policies. Usual dietary intake distributions can be estimated after adjusting for day-to-day variation. NHANES remains open and flexible to incorporate improvements while maintaining data quality and providing timely data to track the nation's nutrition and health status. In summary, NHANES collects dietary data in the context of its broad, multipurpose goals; the strengths and limitations of these data are also discussed in this review.",

        "abstract": "The market for infant formulas has become increasingly competitive over the past decade. Ingredients that manufacturers once included only in specialized formulas are now added to nearly all formulas. These ingredients come with marketing claims, such as “fosters cognitive development” and “supports digestive health.” It is time to ask whether there are data to support these claims. On September 9, 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued its first draft guidance on this topic, which outlines the quality of evidence that formula manufacturers should have to substantiate these claims, including randomized trials.1 The evidence currently available to the public does not meet these standards. For many claims there is no evidence available to the public, and when the results of randomized trials are made public, we learn that they are limited by small sample sizes, poor follow-up, and provide unpersuasive results.2 It is also important to understand how these claims may affect breastfeeding and public health budgets, and to consider regulatory approaches that might produce better publicly available evidence. The story of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs, eg, docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and arachidonic acid [ARA]) highlights how claims that are unsubstantiated in the literature are used in infant formula marketing. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in high levels in breast milk in comparison with unfortified standard formula, and some researchers have hypothesized that this may explain evidence of better cognitive outcomes in breastfed infants. Most manufacturers now add LCPUFAs to their formulas and make such claims as “supports brain development.” However, a 2011 Cochrane review examining 15 studies assessing the benefits of LCPUFAs, including 11 tracking neurodevelopmental outcomes, did not find any benefit to supplementation.2 Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are not the only formula ingredient marketed using these types of claims. Low-lactose formulas (“sensitive”) and those containing prebiotics (“supports immune system”) are marketed to consumers despite a lack of scientific consensus regarding their benefits.3 One recent study found that more than half of the 22 infant formula products reviewed were marketed with claims; none were backed by publicly available scientific evidence. The authors suggested “the purpose of these messages is to widen the use of modified formulas largely in the absence of evidence.”4 The lack of available evidence is related to the regulatory structure for infant formula. These claims are classified by the FDA as structure/function claims (characterizing the relationship between an ingredient and the structure/function of the body without referencing disease, eg, probiotics support digestive health) as opposed to health claims (describing the relationship of an ingredient to a disease, eg, adequate calcium reduces the risk of osteoporosis).1 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, structure/function claims do not require prior authorization by the FDA and are subject to a lower standard of evidence than health claims. Companies are required to have on hand data to substantiate structure/ function claims, but there is no obligation to share the data with the FDA or the public. There are several consequences to the inadequately supported claims used in infant formula marketing. First, the claims may confuse parents into thinking these formulas are equivalent or superior to breastfeeding. In an effort to promote breastfeeding, the World Health Organization’s International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes prohibits directto-consumer advertising of infant formula and discourages the use of marketing claims on packaging.3 Unlike many other developed nations, the United States does not adhere to this code. Second, these unsubstantiated formula additives increase costs for families. In the early 2000s, when LCPUFAs were introduced into the mainstream formula market, wholesale formula prices increased by 7% to 30% in comparison with standard formulas.5 With formula prices inflated by this magnitude, a family might spend an extra $400 per year on formula as a result of these ingredients. Third, the claims reduce the reach of critical federal nutrition programs. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is the single largest purchaser of infant formula in the United States, serving more than half of all infants. WIC is a discretionary federal grant program where states are awarded funds to provide nutritional support to lowincome families. The number of infants served is limited by each state’s WIC budget and the cost of formula. Approximately 30% of infants and children eligible for WIC do not participate due in part to insufficient resources.6 The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated that more than $91 million of the approximately $850 million spent on infant formula by WIC was attributable to the higher price because of ingredients bearing these claims.6 The FDA’s recent draft guidance recommends high standards for studies on the effectiveness of infant formula ingredients. If adopted by the agency, companies would be expected to conduct randomized clinical studies of sufficient size to demonstrate a meaningful clinical outcome. VIEWPOINT",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a historical background for the current nutrition issues faced by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Food Stamp Program evolved into SNAP during a period when U.S. diets, particularly those of the poor, became less healthful. During the 1960s, the U.S. (Kennedy-Johnson era) addressed malnutrition first with a pilot project focused on retail sales and cash food stamps, which showed that low-income consumers purchased relatively healthy foods for a fairly high-quality diet. Southern politicians in the House of Representatives wanted a program similar to an earlier subsidized commodity distribution program. The pilot provided the evidence northern urban politicians sought, and they held the farm bill hostage until southern rural interests agreed to an unfettered Food Stamp Program that allowed purchases directly from retailers. A final Food Stamp Program law was incorporated into the farm bill and passed. This program shifted in 1977 to a full cash benefit system later, first using food stamps to act as cash and later an Electronic Benefit Transfer program. The program was designed at a time of a very healthful diet of lower-SES Americans. As diets of lower-income Americans changed and the entire food system shifted, the program has not been adjusted in any manner. Today, 50%-66% of the calories in the American diet, particularly that of low-SES Americans, come from highly processed foods containing excessive refined carbohydrates, sodium, unhealthy saturated fats, and added sugar. The SNAP design has not responded to these shifts in diet and the powerful interests controlling our food system. This twist in the U.S. diet and food system presents a major dilemma to those attempting to form a healthy food program based on the results of an effective pilot project.",

Although children and their families ultimately make decisions about diet, physical activity, and obesity management, many groups have a role in making these choices easier. They do this by providing families with tools and resources and by implementing policies and practices that support a healthy diet and physical activity in the places where children and their families spend their time. Diabetes educators are an important part of the solution.",

        "abstract": "correspondence to: Jennifer L. Pomeranz, JD, MPH, College of lic Health, New York University, 41 East 11th Street, 7th Floor, NY 10003. E-mail: jlp284@nyu.edu. 97/$36.00 .doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2016.07.040 The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) supports 45 million people, mostly children, elderly, and disabled individuals, at risk for food insecurity. Congress’s Declaration of SNAP Policy states that the program’s goal is to alleviate hunger and malnutrition by raising the levels of nutrition among low-income households. SNAP has been found to successfully reduce food insecurity; however, the program does not seem to be meeting its nutrition-related goals. SNAP participants consume more foods associated with chronic disease, such as sugary beverages, and less foods considered healthful than income-eligible nonparticipants. As a result, SNAP participants’ Healthy Eating Index scores have been assessed to be 10% lower than low-income nonparticipants due to lower scores for fruits, vegetables, whole grains, solid fats, added sugar, and alcohol. Moreover, adult SNAP participants are significantly more likely to be obese than income-eligible nonparticipants. In February 2016, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued proposed regulations to “improve SNAP recipient access to a variety of healthy food options.” The regulations will require SNAP retailers to increase the amount of “staple” and “perishable” foods that they offer. If successfully implemented, the new policy would improve access to healthier foods, especially in small retail locations. However, this will not necessarily result in significant improvements in healthy food consumption by SNAP beneficiaries. The government has increasingly modernized and improved SNAP retailer requirements, but it has not substantially amended the definition of SNAP-eligible food since 1973, despite a nationwide obesity epidemic and evidence that the program is associated with poor nutrition. The USDA has the authority—but has thus far not used it—to conduct a pilot project to test whether amending the definition of SNAP-eligible food would improve nutrition outcomes for participants. This article summarizes the USDA’s new retail regulations and discusses barriers to success for both retailers and SNAP participants. It goes on to argue that the USDA should use its existing authority to pilot a project that tests updating the definition of eligible food to include standards that support the nutrition-related goals of the program.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough increasing access to electronic benefit transfer (EBT) at farmers' markets has become a popular strategy for encouraging healthy eating, its relationships to a number of dietary behaviors in low-income populations are not well understood.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo describe the frequency of and relationships between EBT access, fruit and vegetable intake, and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption among public health center (PHC) clients with access to EBT at farmers' markets during 2011-2012.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nLow-income participants recruited from the waiting rooms of five multipurpose PHCs operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nFruit and vegetable and SSB consumption (number per week).\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nData from the 2012 Los Angeles County Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed using multivariable regressions, with EBT access at farmers' markets as the primary independent variable. Covariates included EBT use, transportation behaviors, neighborhood attributes, and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 1,503 adults participated in the survey (response rate=69%). Of these, 529 reported receiving EBT benefits. Among these benefits recipients, 64% were women, 54% were aged 25 to 44 years, 62% were black, and 75% were unemployed or part-time employed. In multivariable regression analyses, EBT access at farmers' markets was positively associated with higher fruit and vegetable consumption; however, an association to SSB consumption was not demonstrated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEBT access at farmers' markets is related to higher fruit and vegetable consumption among PHC clients in Los Angeles County. However, the finding of no association to SSB consumption raises important questions about the need for strategies to discourage EBT recipients' purchase of foods of minimal nutritional value in other venues that accept nutrition assistance program benefits.",

        "abstract": "Nutrition is the fundamental bridge between food and health. Inadequate fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption has been linked to an increase in global noncommunicable diseases, which places a greater burden on health systems (1) . Despite much emphasis from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on the benefits of increased FV consumption, neither results nor an understanding of the complexity of food security and the actions of a diverse array of stakeholders needed to achieve outcomes have been attained. To address this challenge, the Alliance for Food & Health (AFH) uses a multistakeholder approach to engage cross-sector solutions. This paper, the first in a series, addresses the global challenge of FV consumption by examining and synthesizing current practices and outcomes and providing actionable recommendations for government, private-sector, and civil-society stakeholders. To effectively reduce the global noncommunicable disease (NCD) burden, it is critical that stakeholders work in concordance with the WHO/FAO Second International Conference on Nutrition commitments ( Table 1 ), United Nations (UN) Decade of Action on Nutrition Action Areas ( Table 2 ), and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) applicable to this issue ( Table 3 ). AFH's top line recommendations ( Table 4 ) align with multiple UN SDGs (2) . All recommendations connect with the following three SDGs: #2: \"Zero Hunger,\" #3: \"Good Health and Well-Being,\" and #17: \"Partnerships for the Goals.\" This indicates AFH's integration of the food, agriculture, and global health communities in efforts to combat NCDs. A variety of recommendations align with #9: \"Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure,\" #11: \"Sustainable Cities and Communities,\" and #12: \"Responsible Consumption and Production.\"",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis study examined the effect of stigma (proxied by school-level peer participation), neighborhood food environment, and demographic characteristics on participation in the U.S. Department of Agriculture National School Lunch Program (NSLP).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe 1997 and 2003 waves of the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics were linked to external data on school-level free lunch eligibility rate, fast food restaurant availability in the school zip code, and food store availability and neighborhood socioeconomic status in the home zip code. Probit models examined the effects of contextual and demographic factors on NSLP participation and free/reduced-price NSLP participation, conditional on eligibility. Differences were analyzed by grade.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA 10% higher free lunch eligibility rate in a child's school was associated with a 1.8 percentage point increase in the probability of NSLP participation and 2.6 and 6.7 percentage points increase in free/reduced-price NSLP participation among all and high school eligible student, respectively. Fewer grocery stores and more convenience stores increased NSLP participation. Fast food restaurant availability in the school neighborhood decreased free/reduced-price NSLP participation for high school students only. The addition of the contextual factors reduced the estimated association with several of the demographic covariates, especially race.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe significant positive association between NLSP participation and school-level free lunch eligibility, especially for the free/reduced-price NSLP participation, suggested that stigma, or possibly peers, affected participation. Neighborhood and school contextual variables had significant effects on school lunch take-up and the results differed between high school and elementary/middle school students.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Diet is a modifiable factor associated with pediatric obesity outcomes, but few studies have evaluated the relationships of sleep duration and regularity on dietary intake of young preschool-aged children. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether short sleep duration and irregular sleep timing were associated with greater calorie, carbohydrate and fat consumption among young children with obesity from low-income families. Methods: Fifty-one ethnically diverse children aged 2 to 4 years were recruited from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children clinics in a southeast Texas county. Sleep behaviors were parent reported using the Child Sleep Assessment tool. Dietary intake data were obtained by 24-hour recall interviews (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day). Results: Short sleep duration (<11 hr) was highly prevalent among this cohort of preschool-aged children. Short sleep duration was associated with greater fat and decreased carbohydrate consumption. Children with greater variability in sleep duration and timing had greater energy intake from fat and protein sources. Conclusion: Allowing for the opportunity to educate parents on the importance of maintaining regular, adequate sleep and relationships between sleep and dietary intake may decrease the risk of childhood obesity in this high-risk pediatric population.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Diet is a modifiable factor associated with pediatric obesity outcomes, but few studies have evaluated the relationships of sleep duration and regularity on dietary intake of young preschool-aged children. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether short sleep duration and irregular sleep timing were associated with greater calorie, carbohydrate and fat consumption among young children with obesity from low-income families. Methods: Fifty-one ethnically diverse children aged 2 to 4 years were recruited from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children clinics in a southeast Texas county. Sleep behaviors were parent reported using the Child Sleep Assessment tool. Dietary intake data were obtained by 24-hour recall interviews (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day). Results: Short sleep duration (<11 hr) was highly prevalent among this cohort of preschool-aged children. Short sleep duration was associated with greater fat and decreased carbohydrate consumption. Children with greater variability in sleep duration and timing had greater energy intake from fat and protein sources. Conclusion: Allowing for the opportunity to educate parents on the importance of maintaining regular, adequate sleep and relationships between sleep and dietary intake may decrease the risk of childhood obesity in this high-risk pediatric population.",

This article emphasizes the importance of food systems in generating and exacerbating health disparities in the United States and suggests avenues for reducing them. It presents a conceptual model showing how broad food system conditions interplay with community food environments-and how these relationships are filtered and refracted through prisms of social disparities to generate and exacerbate health disparities. Interactions with demand factors in the social environment are described. The article also highlights the separate food systems pathway to health disparities via environmental and occupational health effects of agriculture.",

To eliminate food insecurity, interventions are needed, including adequate funding for and increased utilization of food and nutrition assistance programs, inclusion of food and nutrition education in such programs, and innovative programs to promote and support individual and household economic self-sufficiency. More than 49 million individuals living in the United States experienced food insecurity in 2008. Negative nutrition and non-nutrition-related outcomes have been associated with food insecurity in children, adolescents, and adults, including substandard academic achievement, inadequate intake of key nutrients, poor health, increased risk for and development of chronic disease, poor disease management, and poor psychological and cognitive functioning. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, can play key roles in ending food insecurity and are uniquely positioned to make valuable contributions through provision of comprehensive food and nutrition education; competent and collaborative practice; innovative research related to accessing a safe, secure, and sustainable food supply; and advocacy efforts at the local, state, regional, and national levels.",

        "abstract": "Latinas experience high rates of poverty, household food insecurity and prenatal depression. To date, only one USA study has examined the relationship between household food insecurity and prenatal depression, yet it focused primarily on non-Latina white and non-Latina black populations. Therefore, this study examined the independent association of household food insecurity with depressive symptoms among low-income pregnant Latinas. This cross-sectional study included 135 low income pregnant Latinas living in Hartford, Connecticut. Women were assessed at enrolment for household food security during pregnancy using an adapted and validated version of the US Household Food Security Survey Module. Prenatal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. A cut-off of ≥21 was used to indicate elevated levels of prenatal depressive symptoms (EPDS). Multivariate backwards stepwise logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for EPDS. Almost one third of participants had EPDS. Women who were food insecure were more likely to experience EPDS compared to food secure women (OR = 2.59; 95% CI = 1.03-6.52). Being primiparous, experiencing heartburn and reporting poor/fair health during pregnancy, as well as having a history of depression were also independent risk factors for experiencing EPDS. Findings from this study suggest the importance of assessing household food insecurity when evaluating depression risk among pregnant Latinas.",

        "abstract": "Objective To examine whether Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants exhibited lower food insecurity when they also demonstrated desirable behaviors in the areas of financial management, nutrition literacy, and conscientious food shopping. Design Using data from the US Department of Agriculture's newly launched National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey, this study examined whether consumer competency is a factor that affects food insecurity. Participants A total of 4,158 participants were included. Sampling weights were applied to represent the population better. Main Outcome Measure(s) Very low food insecurity was the dependent variable. Important independent variables were participants’ financial management skills, nutrition literacy, and conscientious shopping. Analysis Logit and 2‐staged least‐squares models were used for empirical analyses. The significance of models was tested at .05, .01, and .001. Results Consumer competency‐related factors such as financial management ability, not defaulting on bill payments within the previous 6 months, and using the nutrition panel frequently when shopping were negatively associated with food insecurity and very low food security after controlling for a number of other demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics. Conclusions and Implications Policies that focus solely on consumer competency programs such as SNAP‐Education might marginally achieve program goals but the effect would be modest owing to the unique challenges that SNAP participants may face. Further investigations are needed to understand better why SNAP participants do not benefit successfully from competent consumer practices.",

Measures included the Household Food Security Survey Module, diet quality (i.e., comparisons to the Dietary Reference Intakes, Healthy Eating Index), perceived mental health (poor versus good), sociodemographics, and smoking.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this sample, 6.9% were food insecure and 4.5% reported poor mental health. Stratified analysis of food security and mental health status by age/gender found associations for poor diet quality, protein, fat, fibre, and several micronutrients (p-values < 0.05); those who were food insecure tended to have higher suboptimal intakes (p-values < 0.05). After adjustment for covariates, associations in relation to mental health emerged for food insecurity (OR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.45-1.71), poor diet quality (1.61, 95% CI 1.34-1.81), and suboptimal intakes of folate (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.17-1.90) and iron (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.23-1.88).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPopulation approaches that improve food security and intakes of high quality diets may protect people from poor mental health.",

Our analysis is based on data from the 2001-11 Current Population Survey and shows that food insecurity and very low food security among children decline as income-to-needs ratio increases. The point estimates show that the associations are stronger as measured by the new supplemental measure of income-to-needs ratio than when estimated through the official measure. Statistical tests reject the hypothesis that poor households' odds of experiencing low food security are the same whether the SPM or OPM measure is used; but the tests do not reject the hypothesis when very low food security is the outcome.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that all people should have access to a safe food and water supply. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics supports science-based food and water regulations and recommendations that are applied consistently across all foods and water regulated by all agencies and incorporate traceability and recall to limit food- and waterborne outbreaks. Registered dietitian nutritionists and dietetic technicians, registered, are encouraged to participate in policy decisions, program development, and implementation of a food safety culture. Food safety affects all segments of the population in a global society, and, although the United States food and water system has many protections in place, food safety continues to be a public health concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one in six Americans are sickened, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die annually from foodborne disease. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates for foodborne illness, it is estimated that the basic cost-of-illness averages $1,068/episode with a total annual cost of $51 billion. The food safety system is challenged by changing demographics, consumer preferences for convenience and variety, and issues of concern in the commercial food chain and in regulatory systems. The 2011-enacted Food Safety Modernization Act is an extensive expansion of federal food regulatory authority that mandates a risk-based food safety system approach and focuses on comprehensive science-based preventive measures across the total food safety system. Registered dietitian nutritionists and dietetic technicians, registered, have unique roles in promoting and establishing food safety cultures in foodservice settings, clinical practices, community settings, and in public venues because their training integrates food; science; and health, both preventive and therapeutic.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMissouri is an agriculturally intensive state, primarily growing corn and soybeans with additional rice and cotton farming in some southeastern counties. Communities located in close proximity to pesticide-treated fields are known to have increased exposure to pesticides and may be at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. The study aims were to assess the relationship between county-level measures of crop-specific agricultural production and adverse birth outcomes in Missouri and to evaluate the most appropriate statistical methodologies for doing so.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPotential associations between county level data on the densities of particular crops and low birth weight and preterm births were examined in Missouri between 2004-2006. Covariates considered as potential confounders and effect modifiers included gender, maternal race/ethnicity, maternal age at delivery, maternal smoking, access to prenatal care, quarter of birth, county median household income, and population density. These data were analyzed using both standard Poisson regression models as well as models allowing for temporal and spatial correlation of the data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no evidence of an association between corn, soybean, or wheat densities with low birth weight or preterm births. Significant positive associations between both rice and cotton density were observed with both low birth weight and preterm births. Model results were consistent using Poisson and alternative models accounting for spatial and temporal variability.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe associations of rice and cotton with low birth weight and preterm births warrant further investigation. Study limitations include the ecological study design and limited available covariate information.",

For household food insecurity, the corresponding estimates are 11-69%. We also find that maternal depression increases reliance on several types of public programs, suggesting that the programs play a buffering role.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we examined characteristics associated with experiencing persistent and transitional adult food insecurity and how persistent and transitional adult food insecurity influences toddler cognitive and motor development, along with toddler's weight and health status. Using the first 2 waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, 4 mutually exclusive variables capturing persistent and transitional adult food insecurity were created to capture those adults that experience adult food insecurity in the following: both waves, in 1 wave (at 9 or 24 mo after birth), and never experience food insecurity. We used logistic regression models to estimate characteristics associated with the likelihood of experiencing persistent and transitional adult food insecurity. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to estimate how persistent and transitional adult food insecurity influences toddler development. Similar factors influenced one's likelihood of experiencing adult transitional and persistent food insecurity; individuals who experienced any food insecurity were more economically disadvantaged. Thus, outreach efforts do not need to vary by duration of food insecurity. Whereas negative effects of food insecurity on school-aged children are found in the literature, it appears toddlers are buffered from the effects of persistent adult food insecurity. Our findings suggest that toddlers residing with a temporarily food-insecure adult compared with a never food-insecure adult experienced immediate, but small, negative effects on their development. Hence, outreach and assistance may lessen immediate impacts of food insecurity on toddler development.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFood insecurity remains a public health concern in the United States, particularly among low-income urban ethnically diverse families, even with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Limited phenomenologic data exist to capture how programmatic changes to SNAP address the needs of users and why a gap in SNAP use may exist.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe primary aim of this study was to examine the experiences of low-income, Baltimore, MD, mothers in applying for and maintaining access to SNAP. Secondary aims included understanding participants' perspectives on the influence of changes in SNAP over a 3-year period and how SNAP fits into the overall system of social services for families.\n\n\nDESIGN\nIn this qualitative, phenomenologic study, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 mothers and three focus groups with 20 mothers, for a total sample of 33 mothers receiving SNAP benefits. Ten mothers participated in the first round of data collection (January to May 2010), and 23 in the second round (February to May 2013).\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/SETTING\nParticipants were 33 mothers receiving SNAP benefits in Baltimore City, MD.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBaltimore SNAP users' experiences with applying for and maintaining access to SNAP, as well as with program changes to the SNAP program.\n\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nData were analyzed using an iterative emergent design and phenomenologic approach. A constructivist perspective was implemented throughout the coding process.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSNAP functioned as a valuable support system within the broader social safety net for mothers living in poverty, yet participants expressed frustration about the processes of applying for and maintaining benefits due to communication problems and poor integration of services. In applying for and accessing SNAP, positive interactions with caseworkers and previous knowledge of the SNAP program were important for maintaining benefits. Interviews and focus group discussions revealed the need for additional outreach and education about the implemented program changes to build trust and improve access to SNAP among participants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImproving communication and supporting participants' ability to maintain relationships with the same caseworkers, as well as developing better integration with other aid programs, could improve the SNAP program.",

Overweight was defined as a sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for age in the 95th percentile or higher and underweight as a sex-specific BMI for age in less than the fifth percentile on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. These analyses are based on one randomly selected record per child per year for 30 states consistently participating in the CDC Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System in 1989, 1994, and 2000. Prevalence in 1989 and 1994 is adjusted to state-specific age and race/ethnicity distribution of the population in 2000. Overweight and underweight prevalence were categorized as 5% or less, more than 5% to 10%, more than 10% to 15%, more than 15% to 20%, and more than 20%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of states that reported overweight prevalence of more than 10% increased from 11 in 1989 to 28 in 2000. Underweight decreased during the study period: 9 states in 1989 and 23 states in 2000 had a prevalence of 5% or less. No geographic predominance was apparent. Trend analyses showed significant increases in overweight in 30 states (P < .01) and decreases in underweight in 26 states (P < .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOverweight is increasing and underweight is decreasing in our study population. We need to expand prevention and intervention efforts to reverse the rising trend of overweight in the United States.",

Participants were licensed NPs with prescriptive authority in Ohio who were randomly selected from the Ohio licensure list and responded to a questionnaire (n= 288) with demographic and food security-related questions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLess than one third of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they were knowledgeable about the topic of food security. Education of NPs about food insecurity and about incorporation of food security principles into the healthcare process is needed.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nFood insecurity can negatively impact compliance to prescribed treatments. NPs should address food security issues in order to provide specialized, individualized care to patients in order to achieve positive outcomes. Through evaluation of patients' food access, and factors that are related to food insecurity, this can be achieved.",

However, many clinicians working in maternal and child health do not receive adequate university preparation to support breastfeeding. Knowledge and skill are most often gained through on-the-job and personal experience. Myriad resources exist to support clinicians in delivering the best quality care to breastfeeding clients. Among the available resources are policies and protocols of professional organizations, governmental, and health advocacy groups. Breastfeeding-focused academic and continuing education programs are identified. Electronic and other resources for breastfeeding information are available for both professional and consumer audiences.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 20% of all children in the United States live in poverty, which exists in rural, urban, and suburban areas. Thus, all child health clinicians need to be familiar with the effects of poverty on health and to understand associated, preventable, and modifiable social factors that impact health. Social determinants of health are identifiable root causes of medical problems. For children living in poverty, social determinants of health for which clinicians may play a role include the following: child maltreatment, child care and education, family financial support, physical environment, family social support, intimate partner violence, maternal depression and family mental illness, household substance abuse, firearm exposure, and parental health literacy. Children, particularly those living in poverty, exposed to adverse childhood experiences are susceptible to toxic stress and a variety of child and adult health problems, including developmental delay, asthma and heart disease. Despite the detrimental effects of social determinants on health, few child health clinicians routinely address the unmet social and psychosocial factors impacting children and their families during routine primary care visits. Clinicians need tools to screen for social determinants of health and to be familiar with available local and national resources to address these issues. These guidelines provide an overview of social determinants of health impacting children living in poverty and provide clinicians with practical screening tools and resources.",

        "abstract": "Almost half of young children in the United States live in poverty or near poverty. The American Academy of Pediatrics is committed to reducing and ultimately eliminating child poverty in the United States. Poverty and related social determinants of health can lead to adverse health outcomes in childhood and across the life course, negatively affecting physical health, socioemotional development, and educational achievement. The American Academy of Pediatrics advocates for programs and policies that have been shown to improve the quality of life and health outcomes for children and families living in poverty. With an awareness and understanding of the effects of poverty on children, pediatricians and other pediatric health practitioners in a family-centered medical home can assess the financial stability of families, link families to resources, and coordinate care with community partners. Further research, advocacy, and continuing education will improve the ability of pediatricians to address the social determinants of health when caring for children who live in poverty. Accompanying this policy statement is a technical report that describes current knowledge on child poverty and the mechanisms by which poverty influences the health and well-being of children.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis study about maternal feeding practices and beliefs was conducted as background for the development of a childhood obesity prevention program for multi-ethnic parents in the USA receiving services from a federal government supplemental nutrition program for low-income mothers.\n\n\nDESIGN\nUsing a grounded theory approach, focus groups were conducted with low-income African American, white non-Hispanic (i.e. the majority Caucasian American population), Hispanic and Vietnamese parents to collect cross-cultural perspectives on: (a) infant and child feeding practices, (b) childhood overweight, (c) healthy dietary intake, (d) physical activity and inactivity, and (e) infant feeding information sources.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA content analysis of the data yielded three main themes common to all four groups: (a) lack of awareness of the relationship between increased physical activity and health, (b) the use of food to influence behavior, and (c) the loss of parental control over feeding when a child starts child care or school, and revealed perspectives on age-appropriate food, infant satiety, overweight and information sources that were specific to each group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nInterventions that enhance parent self-efficacy that build on themes that are specific to ethnic groups toward preventing childhood obesity are needed. There is also a need for culturally appropriate information for governmental nutrition programs that is in the client's own language and takes into account ethnic differences in beliefs and traditions.",

Among immigrant women who lived in the USA for 10 years or longer, very low food security was significantly associated with higher prevalence of overweight/obesity, after controlling for covariates (PR=1·16; 95 % CI 1·07, 1·27). Among immigrant women who had lived in the USA for less than 10 years, low and very low food security were not significantly associated with overweight/obesity, after controlling for covariates.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFood insecurity may be an important pathway through which weight may increase with longer US residence among immigrant women. Public health programmes and policies should focus on increasing food security for all women, including immigrant women, as one strategy to reduce the prevalence of overweight/obesity.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundBreastfeeding is associated with lower rates of obesity; in addition, it is also associated with later introduction of beverages and foods; however, this has not been well studied among Hispanics. The objective was to assess breastfeeding practices and timing of introduction of beverages and solid foods in a sample of Hispanic infants and their association with weight status.Subject and methodsCross-sectional study in 296 caregivers of infants and toddlers 0–24 months of age participants of a WIC clinic in Puerto Rico. Participants completed several questionnaires and anthropometrics were taken in infants and toddlers. Statistical analysis included correlations, comparison between groups and logistic regression.ResultsA total of 189 participants older than 6 months completed the study. Most infants were breastfed immediately after birth (63.5 %), at the hospital (80.0 %), and at least once (92.3 %) but only 31 % were exclusively breastfed. Median duration of any breastfeeding was 5.0 months and exclusive breastfeeding was 0 months. Excessive weight was found in 22.8 %. Breastfeeding duration was positively associated with caregiver’s educational level and age of introduction of water, formula, juice and cow’s milk (p < 0.05). Exclusively breastfed infants were introduced water and formula at a later age compared to non-exclusively breastfed and never breastfed infants (p < 0.01). No significant associations were found between breastfeeding practices and duration or age of introduction of beverages and foods with weight status, even after adjusting for potential confounders.ConclusionsBreastfeeding duration was in general low. Water, formula and juice were introduced later in breastfed infants compared to non-exclusively breastfed or never breastfed infants. Breastfeeding practices or timing of introduction of beverages and solid foods were not significantly associated with weight status. Strategies to support mothers on continuing breastfeeding beyond the hospital and for longer periods are needed among WIC participants to benefit of the protective effect on childhood obesity.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess elementary school nutrition programs in a rural county in southern Illinois. The researcher interviewed the food service managers of eight schools and completed the School Health Index (SHI) based on their responses. Eighty-seven percent of the schools did not have venues such as vending machines outside the cafeteria. Three food service managers stated that from 75% to 80% of the students in the district ate lunch in the cafeteria. The SHI corresponds to the eight components of a coordinated school health program; nutrition services are just one of the eight components. The SHI is a tool that can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the nutrition program. It covers items from healthy, low-fat choices to food preparation and cafeteria practices. School nurses can work with teachers and food service personnel to create nutrition programs and a curriculum related to healthy nutrition practices.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nHealth care policy positions breastfeeding as an important part of the solution to household food insecurity; however, there are critical gaps in our knowledge of the relationship between breastfeeding duration (exposure variable) and household food insecurity (outcome variable). Our objective was to examine this relationship.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional study was conducted from 2008 to 2016 of healthy urban children (N = 3838) who were 0 to 3years old and recruited from The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!), a practice-based research network in Toronto, Canada. Total breastfeeding duration was collected from parent-reported questionnaires. Household food insecurity was measured using 1-item and 2-item food insecurity screens. Multivariable regression analysis was performed adjusting for prespecified covariates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median total breastfeeding duration was 10.5 months (interquartile range, 6.0-14.0), and 14.7% of households were food insecure. After adjusting for child characteristics (age, sex), maternal characteristics (age, ethnicity, education, employment), and family characteristics (number of children, single parent family, neighborhood equity score), there was no significant association between total breastfeeding duration and household food insecurity (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.01). Although low-income families had an increased odds of being household food insecure (P ≤ .001), we found no significant association between total breastfeeding duration and household food insecurity at varying income levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found no association between breastfeeding duration and household food insecurity, regardless of family income. Although breastfeeding is associated with improved child health outcomes and considered to be part of the solution to household food insecurity, interventions focused on social determinants may provide more promising targets for the prevention of household food insecurity.",

        "abstract": "Although a large majority of US mothers now begin breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding rates fall far below national health objectives, with vulnerable populations being least likely to breastfeed exclusively. This article explores common personal and societal barriers to exclusive breastfeeding and offers evidence-based strategies to support mothers to breastfeed exclusively, such as ensuring prenatal education, supportive maternity practices, timely follow-up, and management of lactation challenges. The article also addresses common reasons nursing mothers discontinue exclusive breastfeeding, including the perception of insufficient milk, misinterpretation of infant crying, returning to work or school, early introduction of solid foods, and lack of support.",

Using the first 2 waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, 4 mutually exclusive variables capturing persistent and transitional adult food insecurity were created to capture those adults that experience adult food insecurity in the following: both waves, in 1 wave (at 9 or 24 mo after birth), and never experience food insecurity. We used logistic regression models to estimate characteristics associated with the likelihood of experiencing persistent and transitional adult food insecurity. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to estimate how persistent and transitional adult food insecurity influences toddler development. Similar factors influenced one's likelihood of experiencing adult transitional and persistent food insecurity; individuals who experienced any food insecurity were more economically disadvantaged. Thus, outreach efforts do not need to vary by duration of food insecurity. Whereas negative effects of food insecurity on school-aged children are found in the literature, it appears toddlers are buffered from the effects of persistent adult food insecurity. Our findings suggest that toddlers residing with a temporarily food-insecure adult compared with a never food-insecure adult experienced immediate, but small, negative effects on their development. Hence, outreach and assistance may lessen immediate impacts of food insecurity on toddler development.",

Although added sugar intake is rooted in behavioral and social factors, few evidence-based, theory-driven socio-behavioral strategies are currently available to address added sugar intake. Dental health professionals are in a position to help identify and address problematic sugar-related behaviors in pediatric patients and advocate for broader upstream approaches, including taxes, warning labels, and policy changes, that can help reduce added sugar intake, prevent tooth decay, and improve health outcomes in vulnerable child populations.",

        "abstract": "Surveys in high-income countries show that inadequacies and deficiencies can be common for some nutrients, particularly in vulnerable subgroups of the population. Inadequate intakes, high requirements for rapid growth and development, or age- or disease-related impairments in nutrient intake, digestion, absorption, or increased nutrient losses can lead to micronutrient deficiencies. The consequent subclinical conditions are difficult to recognize if not screened for and often go unnoticed. Nutrient deficiencies can be persistent despite primary nutrition interventions that are aimed at improving dietary intakes. Secondary prevention that targets groups at high risk of inadequacy or deficiency, such as in the primary care setting, can be a useful complementary approach to address persistent nutritional gaps. However, this strategy is often underestimated and overlooked as potentially cost-effective means to prevent future health care costs and to improve the health and quality of life of individuals. In this paper, the authors discuss key appraisal criteria to consider when evaluating the benefits and disadvantages of a secondary prevention of nutrient deficiencies through screening.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough surveillance data are limited in the US Affiliated Pacific, Alaska, and Hawaii, existing data suggest that the prevalence of childhood obesity is similar to or in excess of other minority groups in the contiguous US. Strategies for addressing the childhood obesity epidemic in the region support the use of community-based, environmentally targeted interventions. The Children’s Healthy Living Program is a partnership formed across institutions in the US Affiliated Pacific, Alaska, and Hawaii to design a community randomized environmental intervention trial and a prevalence survey to address childhood obesity in the region through affecting the food and physical activity environment.Methods/DesignThe Children’s Healthy Living Program community randomized trial is an environmental intervention trial in four matched-pair communities in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and Hawaii and two matched-pair communities in Alaska. A cross-sectional sample of children (goal n = 180) in each of the intervention trial communities is being assessed for outcomes at baseline and at 24 months (18 months post-intervention). In addition to the collection of the participant-based measures of anthropometry, diet, physical activity, sleep and acanthosis nigricans, community assessments are also being conducted in intervention trial communities. The Freely Associated States of Micronesia (Federated States of Micronesia, and Republics of Marshall Islands and Palau) is only conducting elements of the Children’s Healthy Living Program sampling framework and similar measurements to provide prevalence data. In addition, anthropometry information will be collected for two additional communities in each of the 5 intervention jurisdictions to be included in the prevalence survey. The effectiveness of the environmental intervention trial is being assessed based on the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework.DiscussionThe Children’s Healthy Living Program environmental trial is designed to focus on capacity building and to maximize the likelihood of sustainable impact on childhood obesity-related behaviors and outcomes. The multiple measures at the individual, community, and environment levels are designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting change. This approach enhances the likelihood for identifying and promoting the best methods to promote health and well-being of the children in the underserved US Affiliated Pacific Region.Trial registrationNIH clinical trial # NCT01881373",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nMore than 42 million people in the United States are food insecure. Although some health care entities are addressing food insecurity among patients because of associations with disease risk and management, little is known about the components of these initiatives.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Systematic Screening and Assessment Method was used to conduct a landscape assessment of US health care entity-based programs that screen patients for food insecurity and connect them with food resources. A network of food insecurity researchers, experts, and practitioners identified 57 programs, 22 of which met the inclusion criteria of being health care entities that 1) screen patients for food insecurity, 2) link patients to food resources, and 3) target patients including adults aged 50 years or older (a focus of this assessment). Data on key features of each program were abstracted from documentation and telephone interviews.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost programs (n = 13) focus on patients with chronic disease, and most (n = 12) partner with food banks. Common interventions include referrals to or a list of food resources (n = 19), case managers who navigate patients to resources (n = 15), assistance with federal benefit applications (n = 14), patient education and skill building (n = 13), and distribution of fruit and vegetable vouchers redeemable at farmers markets (n = 8). Most programs (n = 14) routinely screen all patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe programs reviewed use various strategies to screen patients, including older adults, for food insecurity and to connect them to food resources. Research is needed on program effectiveness in improving patient outcomes. Such evidence can be used to inform the investments of potential stakeholders, including health care entities, community organizations, and insurers.",

The datasets used inconsistent breastfeeding definitions, limited ethnic descriptors, and varied regarding availability of relevant determinants. Multiple datasets collect breastfeeding data, but a coordinated US breastfeeding monitoring and surveillance system does not exist. Suggestions to improve this system include: standardizing breastfeeding definitions, expanding ethnic/racial descriptors, collecting additional relevant variables, and reducing recall periods.

        "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough surveillance data are limited in the US Affiliated Pacific, Alaska, and Hawaii, existing data suggest that the prevalence of childhood obesity is similar to or in excess of other minority groups in the contiguous US. Strategies for addressing the childhood obesity epidemic in the region support the use of community-based, environmentally targeted interventions. The Children’s Healthy Living Program is a partnership formed across institutions in the US Affiliated Pacific, Alaska, and Hawaii to design a community randomized environmental intervention trial and a prevalence survey to address childhood obesity in the region through affecting the food and physical activity environment.Methods/DesignThe Children’s Healthy Living Program community randomized trial is an environmental intervention trial in four matched-pair communities in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and Hawaii and two matched-pair communities in Alaska. A cross-sectional sample of children (goal n = 180) in each of the intervention trial communities is being assessed for outcomes at baseline and at 24 months (18 months post-intervention). In addition to the collection of the participant-based measures of anthropometry, diet, physical activity, sleep and acanthosis nigricans, community assessments are also being conducted in intervention trial communities. The Freely Associated States of Micronesia (Federated States of Micronesia, and Republics of Marshall Islands and Palau) is only conducting elements of the Children’s Healthy Living Program sampling framework and similar measurements to provide prevalence data. In addition, anthropometry information will be collected for two additional communities in each of the 5 intervention jurisdictions to be included in the prevalence survey. The effectiveness of the environmental intervention trial is being assessed based on the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework.DiscussionThe Children’s Healthy Living Program environmental trial is designed to focus on capacity building and to maximize the likelihood of sustainable impact on childhood obesity-related behaviors and outcomes. The multiple measures at the individual, community, and environment levels are designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting change. This approach enhances the likelihood for identifying and promoting the best methods to promote health and well-being of the children in the underserved US Affiliated Pacific Region.Trial registrationNIH clinical trial # NCT01881373",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nMore than 42 million people in the United States are food insecure. Although some health care entities are addressing food insecurity among patients because of associations with disease risk and management, little is known about the components of these initiatives.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Systematic Screening and Assessment Method was used to conduct a landscape assessment of US health care entity-based programs that screen patients for food insecurity and connect them with food resources. A network of food insecurity researchers, experts, and practitioners identified 57 programs, 22 of which met the inclusion criteria of being health care entities that 1) screen patients for food insecurity, 2) link patients to food resources, and 3) target patients including adults aged 50 years or older (a focus of this assessment). Data on key features of each program were abstracted from documentation and telephone interviews.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost programs (n = 13) focus on patients with chronic disease, and most (n = 12) partner with food banks. Common interventions include referrals to or a list of food resources (n = 19), case managers who navigate patients to resources (n = 15), assistance with federal benefit applications (n = 14), patient education and skill building (n = 13), and distribution of fruit and vegetable vouchers redeemable at farmers markets (n = 8). Most programs (n = 14) routinely screen all patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe programs reviewed use various strategies to screen patients, including older adults, for food insecurity and to connect them to food resources. Research is needed on program effectiveness in improving patient outcomes. Such evidence can be used to inform the investments of potential stakeholders, including health care entities, community organizations, and insurers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nObesity is a complex health problem affecting more than one-third of school-aged youth. The increasing obesity rates in Kansas and Missouri has been particularly concerning, with efforts being made to improve student health through the implementation of school wellness policies (SWPs). The primary purpose of this study was to conduct a rigorous assessment of SWPs in the bi-state region.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSWPs were collected from 46 school districts. The Wellness School Assessment Tool (WellSAT) was used to assess comprehensiveness and strength. Additionally, focus group discussions and an online survey were conducted with school personnel to identify barriers and supports needed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAssessment of the SWPs indicated that most school districts failed to provide strong and specific language. Due to these deficiencies, districts reported lack of enforcement of policies. Several barriers to implementing the policies were reported by school personnel; supports needed for effective implementation were identified.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo promote a healthful school environment, significant improvements are warranted in the strength and comprehensiveness of the SWPs. The focus group discussions provided insight as to where we need to bridge the gap between the current state of policies and the desired beneficial practices to support a healthy school environment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe describe methods used in the Year 6 Follow-Up (Y6FU) of children who participated in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPSII). This study consists of a questionnaire administered 6 years after the IFPSII to characterize the health, development, and diet quality of the children.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Y6FU sample was a subset of those who participated in IFPSII. The IFPSII participants were drawn from a national consumer opinion panel; neither the IFPSII nor the Y6FU sample is nationally representative. The Y6FU sampling frame included all qualified participants who answered at least the first postnatal questionnaire. One questionnaire was administered by mail in 2012, and nonrespondents were contacted for a telephone interview. Survey topics included measures of health, development, diet, physical activity, screen time, and family medical history. We attempted to contact 2958 mothers and obtained completed questionnaires from 1542, a response rate of 52.1%. We conducted 2 sample evaluations, 1 comparing respondents and nonrespondents on data from IFPSII and the other comparing Y6FU respondents with 6-year-old participants in the National Survey of Children's Health.\n\n\nRESULTS\nY6FU mothers are more likely to be white, married, older, and of higher education and income than both nonresponders and nationally representative mothers. Comparisons also revealed health-related differences and similarities.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough not nationally representative, the Y6FU provides a valuable database because of its wide coverage of diet and health issues and its unique ability to link early feeding patterns with outcomes at age 6 years.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity affects 1 in 8 US households and has clear implications for population health disparities. We present a person-centered, multilevel framework for understanding how individuals living in food-insecure households cope with inadequate access to food themselves and within their households, communities, and broader food system. Many of these coping strategies can have an adverse impact on health, particularly when the coping strategies are sustained over time; others may be salutary for health. There exist multiple opportunities for aligning programs and policies so that they simultaneously support food security and improved diet quality in the interest of supporting improved health outcomes. Improved access to these programs and policies may reduce the need to rely on individual- and household-level strategies that may have negative implications for health across the life course.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that children ages 2 to 11 years should achieve optimal physical and cognitive development, attain a healthy weight, enjoy food, and reduce the risk of chronic disease through appropriate eating habits and participation in regular physical activity. The health status of American children has generally improved during the past 3 decades. However, the number of children who are overweight has more than doubled among 2- to 5-year-old children and more than tripled among 6- to 11-year-old children, which has major health consequences. This increase in childhood overweight has broadened the focus of dietary guidance to address children's overconsumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages and physical activity patterns. Health promotion will help reduce diet-related risks of chronic degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, and osteoporosis. This position reviews what US children are eating and explores trends in food and nutrient intakes as well as the impact of school meals on children's diets. Dietary recommendations and guidelines and the benefits of physical activity are also discussed. The roles of parents and caregivers in influencing the development of healthful eating behaviors are highlighted. Specific recommendations and sources of nutrition messages to improve the nutritional well-being of children are provided for food and nutrition professionals",

Benefits to shopping at farmers' markets included supporting local economies, and food price, quality, and safety. Barriers included lack of transportation, location/convenience, hours, and food prices. Assistants rated the benefits to shopping at farmers' markets similarly for themselves and their clients, but rated many of the barriers to shopping at farmers' markets as significantly lower (P < .05) for themselves than for their clients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nFuture assistant trainings should address the connection between agriculture and health, and how to overcome barriers to shopping at farmers' markets for their clients.",

        "abstract": "One in seven Americans participates in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), making it the largest federally funded food assistance program. SNAP benefits are distributed once per month and both food spending and calorie consumption tend to decrease as time from benefit distribution increases. The monthly SNAP benefit cycle has serious implications for the health and financial stability of low-income families, a growing number of whom rely on SNAP as their sole source of income. Relatively little is known about the specific coping strategies households use to manage the SNAP cycle. The purpose of this study is to provide a critical exploration of the nature and timing of coping strategies for managing the SNAP cycle, including implications these coping mechanisms have for health and financial stability. This paper presents data from a prospective cohort study of mothers (n = 12) receiving SNAP benefits in Philadelphia between 2016 and 17. Both in-depth qualitative and survey methods were used. Participants reported on a variety of coping strategies they used to manage the SNAP cycle, including adjustments to shopping and eating patterns, mental accounting, emotional resilience, and social support. Instrumental social support was particularly vital in the final days of the benefit cycle, as were skipping meals and purchasing less expensive, energy-dense foods. Constant vigilance was required throughout the month to manage financial instability. The coping strategies for managing the SNAP cycle have short-term benefits, such as buffering against hunger and financial instability, however these survival strategies may have negative long-term repercussions for physical and financial health.",

Using the Breakthrough Series Collaborative model, HV CoIIN faculty taught a theory of change and continuous quality improvement (CQI) skills, as well as facilitating opportunities for networked learning.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHV CoIIN improved home visitors' breastfeeding competencies and use of data to inform practice. Breastfeeding initiation increased from 47% to 61%. Exclusive breastfeeding of 3-month-old babies increased from 10% to 13.5%, and for babies 6 months old it increased from 5% to 8%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHome visiting programs can improve breastfeeding among participants with very low baseline breastfeeding rates. Continuous quality improvement and the Breakthrough Series Collaborative model can be used to improve home visiting services in ways that advance national public health priorities.",

Milk, fat/cholesterol, diet quality, food security, and fruit/vegetable subscales showed significant correlations with dietary variables. Nineteen items have acceptable reliability. Twenty items showed no baseline differences by ethnic group. Eleven of the 15 items expected to show change following the intervention demonstrated sensitivity to change.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nThis brief food behavior checklist (16 items) is easy to administer to a client group, has an elementary reading level (fourth grade), and has a low respondent burden in addition to meeting requirements for validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change. This study establishes a process that can be used by other researchers to develop and further refine instruments for use in community health promotion interventions.",

We used a descriptive design consisting of small group interviews of low-income pregnant women and identified 6 of 18 women as eating healthy diets. Women with healthy diets knew to eat balanced meals, had family support, were willing to prepare foods that were different than other family members, and ate at home more frequently than women with unhealthy diets. Health care providers can use the positive deviance approach to guide the development of interventions to improve women's diets using community-specific solutions to enhance the health of mothers and infants.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundPoor feeding practices during infancy contribute to obesity risk. As infants transition from human milk and/or formula-based diets to solid foods, these practices interfere with infant feeding self-regulation and healthy growth patterns. Compared with other socioeconomic groups, lower-income mothers are more likely to experience difficulty feeding their infants. This may include misinterpreting feeding cues and using less-than-optimal feeding styles and practices, such as pressuring infants during mealtimes and prematurely introducing solid food and sweetened beverages. The Healthy Babies trial aims to determine the efficacy of a community-based randomized controlled trial of an in-home intervention with economically and educationally disadvantaged mother-infant dyads. The educational intervention is being conducted during the infant's first 6 months of life to promote healthy transition to solids during their first year and is based on the theory of planned behavior.Methods/DesignWe will describe our study protocol for a multisite randomized control trial being conducted in Colorado and Michigan with an anticipated sample of 372 economically and educationally disadvantaged African American, Hispanic, and Caucasian mothers with infants. Participants are being recruited by county community agency staff. Participants are randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group. The intervention consists of six in-home visits by a trained paraprofessional instructor followed by three reinforcement telephone contacts when the baby is 6, 8, and 10 months old. Main maternal outcomes include a) maternal responsiveness, b) feeding style, and c) feeding practices. Main infant outcome is infant growth pattern. All measures occur at baseline and when the infant is 6 and 12 months old.DiscussionIf this project is successful, the expected outcomes will address whether the home-based early nutrition education intervention is effective in helping mothers develop healthy infant feeding practices that contribute to improving infant health and development and reducing the risk of early-onset childhood obesity.Trial RegistrationCurrent Controlled Trials ACTRN126100000415000",

Different models of FTI programs exist. On-site farmer's markets at institutions have been promoted on federal government property, healthcare facilities, and private institutions nationwide. Farm to School programs focus on connecting schools with local agricultural production with the goal of improving school meals and increasing intake of fruits and vegetables in children. Sourcing food from local farms presents a number of challenges including cost and availability of local products, food safety, and liability considerations and lack of skilled labor for food preparation. Institutions utilize multiple strategies to address these barriers, and local, state, and federal polices can help facilitate FTI approaches. FTI enables the purchasing power of institutions to contribute to regional and local food systems, thus potentially affecting social, economic, and ecological systems. Local and state food policy councils can assist in bringing stakeholders together to inform this process. Rigorous research and evaluation is needed to determine and document best practices and substantiate links between FTI and multiple outcomes. Nutritionists, public health practitioners, and researchers can help communities work with institutions to develop, implement, and evaluate programs and policies supporting FTI.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess change in household food security associated with participation in a pediatric fruit/vegetable prescription program. Methods: The researchers analyzed clinic‐based, fruit/vegetable prescription program data for 578 low‐income families, collected in 2013–2015, and calculated changes in food security (summative score; high/low/very low; and individual US Department of Agriculture measures). Results: Of participating households, 72% increased their summative score over the course of the program. In adjusted regression models, participants had higher change scores with 5 or 6 clinical visits, compared with 1 or 2 visits (&bgr; = .07; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.14), and college education of the primary caretaker, compared with less than college (&bgr; = .05; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.09). Select clinic sites (but neither visit nor redemption proportions) significantly contributed to change score variance. All US Department of Agriculture measures saw significant increases. Conclusions and Implications: Fruit/vegetable prescription programs may help providers address patients' food insecurity. Further research using experimental designs and implementation science could build the case to incorporate programs into practice.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity is a persistent concern in high-income countries, and has been associated with poor mental health, particularly among females. We conducted a scoping review to characterize the state of the evidence on food insecurity and mental health among women in high-income countries. The research databases PubMed, EMBASE, and psycINFO were searched using keywords capturing food insecurity, mental health, and women. Thirty-nine articles (representing 31 unique studies/surveys) were identified. Three-quarters of the articles drew upon data from a version of the United States Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module. A range of mental health measures were used, most commonly to measure depression and depressive symptoms, but also anxiety and stress. Most research was cross-sectional and showed associations between depression and food insecurity; longitudinal analyses suggested bidirectional relationships (with food insecurity increasing the risk of depressive symptoms or diagnosis, or depression predicting food insecurity). Several articles focused on vulnerable subgroups, such as pregnant women and mothers, women at risk of homelessness, refugees, and those who had been exposed to violence or substance abuse. Overall, this review supports a link between food insecurity and mental health (and other factors, such as housing circumstances and exposure to violence) among women in high-income countries and underscores the need for comprehensive policies and programs that recognize complex links among public health challenges.",

        "abstract": "Pediatric hyperlipidemias increasingly require dietary management of overweight and obesity for resolution. Dietary management of inappropriate weight gain may be outside of normal pediatric expertise. This review used scientific statements of expert professional groups, federal program documentation, and selected original articles or opinions to survey dietary techniques and highlight continuing controversies and therapeutic successes. At present, complex societal and environmental factors underlie the current epidemic in pediatric overweight, precluding definitive statements of best practices. Thus, although first-generation professional group recommendations are available, clinicians should expect recommendations to change. However, lack of standardized practices to assess the degree and quality of overweight (central versus peripheral adiposity) limit objective determination of therapeutic need and timely referral to nutrition professionals. Dietary management of insulin-resistant, overweight/obese children with dyslipidemias (metabolic syndrome) requires appropriate laboratory diagnostics to ensure that total fat and energy restrictions do not provoke or exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia or liver fat accumulation. Integrated treatment approaches that combine nutrition education, behavioral modification, and individualized diet instruction are showing success. Diet instructions that include practical translation of nutrition principles to daily eating habits are able to bring about substantial dietary change. The role of the school as a significant component of a child's lifestyle is described, as well as consideration of federally mandated feeding programs as a factor in designing effective dietary management strategies for those likely to be at high risk for overweight and dyslipidemias. The need for coordination among families, and health and school professionals to achieve success is emphasized.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of ReviewThis paper seeks to answer the following two questions: (1) Is participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) associated with changes in obesity and overweight? and (2) What obesity prevention interventions in the WIC setting may be most effective for obesity prevention?Recent FindingsThe available evidence supports the conceptualization of the role of WIC in obesity prevention across the life course, with suggested impacts/influence on gestational weight gain during pregnancy, rapid infant weight gain during infancy, healthy lifestyle behavior during interconception, and prevalence of obesity during early childhood. Through the provision of nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and healthy foods and beverages, the WIC program has the potential to influence the mother’s nutritional knowledge and her and her child’s dietary intake and behaviors in a positive way.SummaryGiven the wide reach of the program and the high quality of height/weight measurements taken by the WIC program, WIC has the potential to capitalize upon the early critical periods of development to reduce the incidence of overweight and obesity in a substantial proportion of low-income women and children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis study examined the effect of stigma (proxied by school-level peer participation), neighborhood food environment, and demographic characteristics on participation in the U.S. Department of Agriculture National School Lunch Program (NSLP).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe 1997 and 2003 waves of the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics were linked to external data on school-level free lunch eligibility rate, fast food restaurant availability in the school zip code, and food store availability and neighborhood socioeconomic status in the home zip code. Probit models examined the effects of contextual and demographic factors on NSLP participation and free/reduced-price NSLP participation, conditional on eligibility. Differences were analyzed by grade.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA 10% higher free lunch eligibility rate in a child's school was associated with a 1.8 percentage point increase in the probability of NSLP participation and 2.6 and 6.7 percentage points increase in free/reduced-price NSLP participation among all and high school eligible student, respectively. Fewer grocery stores and more convenience stores increased NSLP participation. Fast food restaurant availability in the school neighborhood decreased free/reduced-price NSLP participation for high school students only. The addition of the contextual factors reduced the estimated association with several of the demographic covariates, especially race.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe significant positive association between NLSP participation and school-level free lunch eligibility, especially for the free/reduced-price NSLP participation, suggested that stigma, or possibly peers, affected participation. Neighborhood and school contextual variables had significant effects on school lunch take-up and the results differed between high school and elementary/middle school students.",

        "abstract": "Policies to improve food accessibility in underserved areas often use direct financial incentives to attract new food retailers. Our analysis of data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Georgia before and after the Great Recession suggests that increased program enrollment improves access to food for SNAP beneficiaries by acting as an indirect subsidy to retailers. We divided food stores into four categories: large, midsize, small, and specialty retailers. Between 2008 and 2011 the number of SNAP enrollees increased by 87 percent, and between 2007 and 2014 the number of SNAP retailers in Georgia increased by 82 percent, primarily because of growth in the number of authorized small retailers. Inside metropolitan Atlanta, changes in the numbers of SNAP enrollees and authorized retailers were positively and significantly associated for small retailers. For the areas outside of metropolitan Atlanta, the association between changes in numbers of enrollees and authorized retailers was strongest for small retailers; more modest associations were also seen for large and specialty retailers. Policy makers should consider how retailers' sensitivity to and reliance on SNAP funding can be leveraged to improve not only food availability, but also access to healthy foods.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe federal mandate for local wellness policies (LWP) provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve schools' practices that support student health, which, in turn, supports academic achievement. With a full agenda and budget challenges, districts need resources and support to turn policies into sustainable practices. The purpose of this study was to assess district policy goals and compare them to the federal mandate and benchmarks of best practices. It is hoped that this information will lead to development of specific assistance in the areas of policy implementation, evaluation, and revision.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAction for Healthy Kids (AFHK) collected a convenience sample of 256 approved LWP. The sample included districts with small, medium, and large student enrollment from every state (except Hawaii). Policies were compared to federal requirements and the AFHK Wellness Policy Fundamentals, a tool which documents best practices for nutrition and physical activity in schools.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-eight percent of policies sampled were consistent with the mandates set forth in the law. Thirty-two percent did not address 1 or more goal areas set by the federal mandate with 15% not addressing goals for evaluation and monitoring. None of the policies addressed all components of AFHK's Fundamentals. Less than 1% addressed all 4 of the evaluation components. Teacher requirements and training for nutrition and physical education were addressed by 43% and 45% of policies, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study's findings indicate schools will need assistance to meet each of the mandates provided by the federal mandate. Areas lacking attention in policies, yet essential for sustaining wellness practices, include assurances of qualified staff, opportunities for staff development, and implementation, evaluation, and revision of the policy.",

        "abstract": "The US food system functions within a complex nexus of social, political, economic, cultural, and ecological factors. Among them are many dynamic pressures such as population growth, urbanization, socioeconomic inequities, climate disruption, and the increasing demand for resource-intensive foods that place immense strains on public health and the environment. This review focuses on the role that policy plays in defining the food system, particularly with regard to agriculture. It further examines the challenges of making the food supply safe, nutritious, and sustainable, while respecting the rights of all people to have access to adequate food and to attain the highest standard of health. We conclude that the present US food system is largely unhealthy, inequitable, environmentally damaging, and insufficiently resilient to endure the impacts of climate change, resource depletion, and population increases, and is therefore unsustainable. Thus, it is imperative that the US embraces policy reforms to transform the food system into one that supports public health and reflects the principles of human rights and agroecology for the benefit of current and future generations.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that children ages 2 to 11 years should achieve optimal physical and cognitive development, attain a healthy weight, enjoy food, and reduce the risk of chronic disease through appropriate eating habits and participation in regular physical activity. The health status of American children has generally improved over the past three decades. However, the number of children who are overweight has more than doubled among 2- to 5-year-old children and more than tripled among 6- to 11-year-old children, which has major health consequences. This increase in childhood overweight has broadened the focus of dietary guidance to address children's over consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages and physical activity patterns. Health promotion will help reduce diet-related risks of chronic degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, and osteoporosis. This position paper reviews what US children are eating and explores trends in food and nutrient intakes as well as the impact of school meals on children's diets. Dietary recommendations and guidelines and the benefits of physical activity are also discussed. The roles of parents and caregivers in influencing the development of healthy eating behaviors are highlighted. The American Dietetic Association works with other allied health and food industry professionals to translate dietary recommendations and guidelines into achievable, healthful messages. Specific recommendations to improve the nutritional well-being of children are provided for dietetics professionals, parents, and caregivers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAs policy strategies are rapidly being developed to address childhood overweight, a system was developed to systematically and reliably classify state policies related to the school nutrition environment. This study describes the development process, the inter-rater reliability to code state policies enacted as of December 2003, and the variability in state policies related to the school nutrition environment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe development of the School Nutrition Environment State Policy Classification System (SNESPCS) included a comprehensive review of published literature, reports from government and nongovernmental sources, input from an expert panel, and select experts. Baseline statutes and regulations for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia were retrieved from Westlaw (data retrieved in 2005-2006 and analyzed in 2006) and pilot testing of the system was conducted.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSNESPCS included 11 policy areas that relate to a range of environmental and surveillance domains. At baseline, states had no (advertising/promotion and preferential pricing) or modest (school meal environment, reimbursable school meals, coordinating or advisory councils, body mass index screening) activities in many of the policy areas. As of 2003, 60% of the states had policies related to the sale of foods in school that compete with the school meal program.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEvaluation of policies that affect the school-nutrition environment is in its earliest stage. SNESPCS provides a mechanism for assessing variation in state policies that can be incorporated in an evaluation framework aimed at elucidating the impact of state policies on the school environment, social norms, and children's dietary behaviors in schools.",

        "abstract": "Unhealthy diets can lead to various diseases, which in turn can translate into a bigger burden for the state in the form of health services and lost production. Obesity alone has enormous costs and claims thousands of lives every year. Although diet quality in the European Union has improved across countries, it still falls well short of conformity with the World Health Organization dietary guidelines. In this review, we classify types of policy interventions addressing healthy eating and identify through a literature review what specific policy interventions are better suited to improve diets. Policy interventions are classified into two broad categories: information measures and measures targeting the market environment. Using this classification, we summarize a number of previous systematic reviews, academic papers, and institutional reports and draw some conclusions about their effectiveness. Of the information measures, policy interventions aimed at reducing or banning unhealthy food advertisements generally have had a weak positive effect on improving diets, while public information campaigns have been successful in raising awareness of unhealthy eating but have failed to translate the message into action. Nutritional labeling allows for informed choice. However, informed choice is not necessarily healthier; knowing or being able to read and interpret nutritional labeling on food purchased does not necessarily result in consumption of healthier foods. Interventions targeting the market environment, such as fiscal measures and nutrient, food, and diet standards, are rarer and generally more effective, though more intrusive. Overall, we conclude that measures to support informed choice have a mixed and limited record of success. On the other hand, measures to target the market environment are more intrusive but may be more effective.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis study examined the effect of stigma (proxied by school-level peer participation), neighborhood food environment, and demographic characteristics on participation in the U.S. Department of Agriculture National School Lunch Program (NSLP).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe 1997 and 2003 waves of the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics were linked to external data on school-level free lunch eligibility rate, fast food restaurant availability in the school zip code, and food store availability and neighborhood socioeconomic status in the home zip code. Probit models examined the effects of contextual and demographic factors on NSLP participation and free/reduced-price NSLP participation, conditional on eligibility. Differences were analyzed by grade.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA 10% higher free lunch eligibility rate in a child's school was associated with a 1.8 percentage point increase in the probability of NSLP participation and 2.6 and 6.7 percentage points increase in free/reduced-price NSLP participation among all and high school eligible student, respectively. Fewer grocery stores and more convenience stores increased NSLP participation. Fast food restaurant availability in the school neighborhood decreased free/reduced-price NSLP participation for high school students only. The addition of the contextual factors reduced the estimated association with several of the demographic covariates, especially race.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe significant positive association between NLSP participation and school-level free lunch eligibility, especially for the free/reduced-price NSLP participation, suggested that stigma, or possibly peers, affected participation. Neighborhood and school contextual variables had significant effects on school lunch take-up and the results differed between high school and elementary/middle school students.",

        "abstract": "Policies to improve food accessibility in underserved areas often use direct financial incentives to attract new food retailers. Our analysis of data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Georgia before and after the Great Recession suggests that increased program enrollment improves access to food for SNAP beneficiaries by acting as an indirect subsidy to retailers. We divided food stores into four categories: large, midsize, small, and specialty retailers. Between 2008 and 2011 the number of SNAP enrollees increased by 87 percent, and between 2007 and 2014 the number of SNAP retailers in Georgia increased by 82 percent, primarily because of growth in the number of authorized small retailers. Inside metropolitan Atlanta, changes in the numbers of SNAP enrollees and authorized retailers were positively and significantly associated for small retailers. For the areas outside of metropolitan Atlanta, the association between changes in numbers of enrollees and authorized retailers was strongest for small retailers; more modest associations were also seen for large and specialty retailers. Policy makers should consider how retailers' sensitivity to and reliance on SNAP funding can be leveraged to improve not only food availability, but also access to healthy foods.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this longitudinal study was to determine the feasibility of a model for disseminating community-based strength training programs for older adults through leadership training of laypersons or \"peers\" and health and fitness professionals. The intervention consisted of a progressive strength training, balance, and flexibility exercise program and a leader training and certification workshop. Feasibility was defined as 75% or more of individuals who completed leader training establishing or teaching at least two 12-week strength training classes within 1 year. Program dissemination was quantified as the number of classes established between January 2005 and December 2006. Demographic characteristics and health status of leaders and program participants were evaluated. Two hundred forty-four leaders (peers, n=149; professionals, n=95) were trained and certified. Seventy-nine percent of all leaders (n=193) met the feasibility criteria of establishing or teaching strength training classes. There was no difference in the percentage of peer leaders (80%, n=119) and professional leaders (78%, n=74) who established or taught classes (P5.71) despite significant differences in their demographic and health profiles. Ninety-seven self-sustaining strength training classes were established in senior and community centers, and 2,217 older adults (women, n=1,942; men, n=275) aged 50 to 97 with multiple chronic medical conditions enrolled. In conclusion, training peer and professional leaders is a feasible and successful model for disseminating a community strength training program for older adults. Widespread dissemination of this program has significant public health implications for increasing physical activity participation by older adults.",

Rhodes responds: The Institute of Medicine report, Preventing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance , (2005) recommended the establishment of a presidential task force to make childhood obesity prevention a national priority and to coordinate activities and budgets for this goal across federal agencies. This has not been done. As a result, efforts are fragmented and inconsistent. Having said that, the U.S. Congress and several federal agencies are involved in obesity prevention and treatment efforts. Two major congressional initiatives were contained in the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization of 2004 (Public Law 108–265, 2004). WIC is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children funded through the Department of Agriculture. There are 8 million participants who receive milk, baby food, and cereal through the program. When funding for the WIC program was reauthorized in 2004, the program was expanded to include fresh fruit and vegetables for recipients. In the same bill, school districts participating in the National School Lunch Program or the School Breakfast Program (together, these programs serve almost 40 million children) were required to have a wellness policy by the beginning of the 2006–2007 school year. The wellness policy must include goals for nutrition education, physical activity, guidelines for food and beverages served throughout school buildings, and other school-based activities designed to promote wellness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe study investigated how nutrient standards affected the number of kilocalories and grams of fat and saturated fat in competitive foods offered and sold in 3 high schools.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study is a quasi-experimental design with 3 schools serving as the units of assignment and analysis. The effect of the nutrient standards was measured by the change in kilocalories and grams of fat and saturated fat in offerings and purchases of competitive foods pre- and postimplementation of the standards. A paired sample t-test was used to compare kilocalories and grams of fat and saturated fat pre- and postimplementation of nutrition standards.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter the implementation of the nutrition standards, students in 3 high schools purchased significantly smaller numbers of kilocalories and grams of fat and saturated fat, during the postpolicy school year of 2007-2008 than during the prepolicy school year of 2004-2005.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nUsing nutrient standards to guide the selection of competitive foods offered in school cafeterias may positively affect intake of kilocalories, total grams of fat, and total saturated fat of those foods. The quantitative assessment is novel and demonstrates the reduction in kilocalories and fat in both the competitive food offerings and purchases as a result of nutrient standards.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity is a pressing issue in the United States where one in six people suffer from hunger. The older adult population faces unique challenges to receiving adequate nutrition. The federal government currently employs four food and nutrition programs that target the senior population in an effort to address their specific needs. These are the Congregate Meals and Home Delivered Meals Programs (provided through the Older Americans Act), and the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and Child and Adult Care Food Program (provided by the United States Department of Agriculture). As the older adult population continues to grow, it will be important to evaluate and improve these programs and the social policies related to them. This manuscript describes each policy in depth, considers economic and political elements that have shaped each policy, describes the level of program success, and offers suggestions for future research and program development.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nHousehold energy security has not been measured empirically or related to child health and development but is an emerging concern for clinicians and researchers as energy costs increase. The objectives of this study were to develop a clinical indicator of household energy security and assess associations with food security, health, and developmental risk in children <36 months of age.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional study that used household survey and surveillance data was conducted. Caregivers were interviewed in emergency departments and primary care clinics form January 2001 through December 2006 on demographics, public assistance, food security, experience with heating/cooling and utilities, Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status, and child health. The household energy security indicator includes energy-secure, no energy problems; moderate energy insecurity, utility shutoff threatened in past year; and severe energy insecurity, heated with cooking stove, utility shutoff, or >or=1 day without heat/cooling in past year. The main outcome measures were household and child food security, child reported health status, Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status concerns, and hospitalizations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 9721 children, 11% (n = 1043) and 23% (n = 2293) experienced moderate and severe energy insecurity, respectively. Versus children with energy security, children with moderate energy insecurity had greater odds of household food insecurity, child food insecurity, hospitalization since birth, and caregiver report of child fair/poor health, adjusted for research site and mother, child, and household characteristics. Children with severe energy insecurity had greater adjusted odds of household food insecurity, child food insecurity, caregivers reporting significant developmental concerns on the Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status scale, and report of child fair/poor health. No significant association was found between energy security and child weight for age or weight for length.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs household energy insecurity increases, infants and toddlers experienced increased odds of household and child food insecurity and of reported poor health, hospitalizations, and developmental risks.",

In substitution analyses, replacing one serving a day of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with one serving a day of non-starchy vegetables was associated with decreased risk of hypertension (hazard ratio 0.93, 0.89 to 0.96).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHigher intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes and French fries was independently and prospectively associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension in three large cohorts of adult men and women.",

The Call to Action identified 20 key action steps to address society-wide breastfeeding barriers in six areas: mothers and families, communities, healthcare, employment, research, and public health infrastructure. This report highlights major federal activities that show progress toward answering the Call to Action in the first 5 years since its launch.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSchool wellness policies are a key component to the prevention of adolescent obesity. This national research study sought to understand the wellness environment in school districts across the country and to identify challenges districts face and needs they have in order to effectively implement, monitor, and evaluate school wellness policies. The study determined (1) perceptions, barriers, and opportunities regarding the development, implementation, and monitoring/evaluation of school wellness policies among school board members, state school boards association leaders, state public health nutrition directors, and school wellness advocates; (2) the readiness and capacity of survey groups to address nutrition and physical activity policies; (3) the extent to which survey groups collaborate; and (4) the acceptability of wellness tools.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn 2006, over 2900 individuals participated in online surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews. School board members represented 1296 school districts across the nation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSchool board members expressed the highest level of confidence among all survey groups that their district has the capacity to develop, implement, and monitor/ evaluate the wellness policy. The disparities among groups are most notable with regard to perceptions of district capacity to monitor/evaluate the policy. School board members are interested in school wellness policy tools and trainings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is an opportunity for state school boards associations, state public health nutrition directors, and school wellness advocates to build their own capacity to provide training and resources to districts on wellness issues, particularly physical education/activity, school-based wellness initiatives, and strategies for implementing and monitoring/evaluating wellness policies.",

A randomized experimental group completed 5 FSNE lessons as an intervention between a pre- and posttest, whereas a control group completed a pre- and posttest without FSNE intervention.\n\n\nSETTING\nClient homes and community locations in 24 Indiana counties.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nFemale head-of-household participants >or= 18 years old; n = 219.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nFSNE lessons targeting food insecurity and nutrition.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nDependent variables food insecurity and food insufficiency were quantified with the 6-item United States Household Food Security Scale and United States Department of Agriculture Food Insufficiency Question, respectively. The independent variable was the randomly assigned treatment group.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nParticipants' characteristics were compared with chi-square analysis. Analyses of covariance models were constructed to find the effect of treatment group on food insecurity and food insufficiency. Significance indicated at P <or= .05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFood insecurity and food insufficiency in the experimental group compared with the control group were significantly improved (P = .03, P = .04, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nFSNE was successful in improving participants' food insecurity and food insufficiency, indicating nutrition education is an appropriate intervention for food insecurity.",

        "abstract": "The author explores the history of breastfeeding in America. Popular belief is that medicine, science, and the formula industry have had the most impact on women's decisions to bottle versus breastfeed. What cannot be overlooked are other areas of influence. Cultural practices, including the beliefs of colonial Americans, the increased social value of children in the 20th century, and the emergence of a middle class, have influenced maternal decision making. The first and second waves of feminism affected women's choices. Politics and religion have had multiple and varied influences. It is this author's position that culture, gender, politics, and religion, as well as medicine, science, and industry, have combined to affect feeding choices. All of these influences, as well as others, both unforeseen and unpredictable, will continue to affect the future of breastfeeding in our society. J Hum Lact. 25(1):85-94. Este reporte explora la historia de lactancia materna en America. La creencia popular es que la medicina, la ciencia y la industria de formula son los que han tenido mas impacto en las decisiones de las mujeres sobre alimentación con biberón versus lactancia materna. No podemos ignorar otras áreas de influencia. Las practicas culturales como las creencias de los americanos de la colonia, el aumento del valor social de la niñez en el siglo 20 y el aumento de la clase media han tenido influencia en la decisión materna. La primera y segunda ola de feminismo impactaron las opciones de las mujeres. La política y la religión han tendido múltiples y variadas influencias. El autor expresa su opinión que tanto la cultura, genero, política y religión como medicina, ciencia e industria combinadas han tenido un impacto en opciones de alimentación. Todas estas influencias, como otras, ambas imprevistas e impredecibles continuarán teniendo impacto en el futuro de la lactancia materna en nuestra sociedad.",

        "abstract": "Anecdotal and descriptive evidence has led to the claim that some low-income households may face a \"eat or breathe\" tradeoff, but quantitative evidence is scarce. We link Medicaid claims data to monthly Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) participation data from the state of Missouri from 2010 to 2013 to explore monthly patterns in children's emergency room (ER) claims for asthma and to examine whether these patterns are sensitive to the timing and amount of SNAP benefits. This allows us to empirically test whether SNAP households with Medicaid insurance face trade-offs between food and medicine that increases the likelihood that a child in a SNAP and Medicaid household will go to the ER for asthma at the end of the month. While we do not find overwhelming evidence that the timing of SNAP benefits receipt are associated with the timing of asthma-related ER visits, we do find clear evidence that increased SNAP benefits are associated with a reduction in the overall probability of an asthma-related ER visit.",

        "abstract": "During the mid-1960s, the United States adopted a series of cash and in-kind transfer programs, as well as human capital investment strategies, as part of the War on Poverty. A number of other programs were first proposed as part of this \"war\" but were not implemented until the mid-1970s. These programs had noble goals: to increase incomes at the bottom of the income distribution, reduce poverty, and improve nutrition, heath, and human capital. However, various features of the programs also had the potential to produce unintended consequences: for example, means-tested programs can discourage work. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the main War on Poverty programs that were aimed at the low-income nonelderly population along with several follow-on programs. We focus on both intended and unintended consequences, drawing on the most compelling causal evidence. We conclude with a series of lessons learned and questions that are outstanding.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we show how household health, economic instability, and food insecurity are inextricably linked; disruptions in individual health or income create cumulative and interdependent challenges faced by multiple household members. Drawing upon semi-structured focus groups with English- and Spanish-speaking clients of an urban food pantry, we demonstrate: (1) the impact of economic scarcity on health, (2) the impact of one household member's health on the health and food security of all household members, and (3) food sharing behaviors among family and social networks, including multi-generational families and non-kin individuals. We identify the gap between household-level assessments of food insecurity and individual-level health reports, which may obscure poor health among other household members. Understanding the social and family context of health and food insecurity may inform future interventions that address the interrelated challenges of diverse and disadvantaged households and communities.",

        "abstract": "Subject recruitment is a challenge for researchers and evaluators, particularly with populations that are traditionally hard to reach and involve in research, such as low-income and minority groups. However, when the evaluation sample does not reflect a program's intended audience, the discrepancy may lead to evaluation results that are not valid for that audience. We conducted evaluation activities for a state Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) intervention that promotes consumption of fruits and vegetables (F&V) in low-income areas. Previous program evaluations efforts had failed to obtain a sufficient proportion of individuals identified as low-income based on their participation in SNAP. We used state Medicaid data as a means of identifying low-income families to recruit for a telephone survey (n=311) and an in-depth qualitative interview (n=30) that we designed for the program being evaluated. We chose to focus on the dynamics of parent-child communication around F&V because we considered this previously unevaluated component of the intervention vital to understanding program effectiveness. Our results indicated that the Medicaid database provided an appropriate sample and that parents reported frequent F&V requests from their children. Parents also reported that they would positively respond to requests in many different settings, such as grocery stores (92.6%), restaurants (88.1%), and fast food restaurants (80.4%).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program benefits nutritionally vulnerable populations by providing them with vouchers to buy healthful foods. In the retail sphere, the WIC program faces 2 challenges to maximizing its effectiveness: ensuring a positive retail experience that leads to full redemption of benefit vouchers and controlling food costs paid by the program. Unfavorable retail experiences may result in reductions in WIC benefit redemption, switching to other stores (even if expensive), or program dropout. We find that these WIC customer experiences depend on retailer size, store crowding, employee–customer interactions, and retailers’ WIC program management. WIC vendor managers can set normative retailer benchmarks of what is expected for WIC customer experiences resulting in WIC participant retention, thereby nudging underperforming retailers to improve and rewarding already excellent performing retailers.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nIn this study, we evaluated the relationship between household food security status and developmental risk in young children, after controlling for potential confounding variables.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Children's Sentinel Nutritional Assessment Program interviewed (in English, Spanish, or Somali) 2010 caregivers from low-income households with children 4 to 36 months of age, at 5 pediatric clinic/emergency department sites (in Arkansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania). Interviews included demographic questions, the US Food Security Scale, and the Parents' Evaluations of Developmental Status. The target child from each household was weighed, and weight-for-age z score was calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, 21% of the children lived in food-insecure households and 14% were developmentally \"at risk\" in the Parents' Evaluations of Developmental Status assessment. In logistic analyses controlling for interview site, child variables (gender, age, low birth weight, weight-for-age z score, and history of previous hospitalizations), and caregiver variables (age, US birth, education, employment, and depressive symptoms), caregivers in food-insecure households were two thirds more likely than caregivers in food-secure households to report that their children were at developmental risk.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nControlling for established correlates of child development, 4- to 36-month-old children from low-income households with food insecurity are more likely than those from low-income households with food security to be at developmental risk. Public policies that ameliorate household food insecurity also may improve early child development and later school readiness.",

Teachers taught lessons about finding and choosing healthy food (61%), relationship between diet and health (54%), and MyPyramid (52%) most often. Suburban teachers (12.4 ± 12.5 hours) taught significantly (P = .006) more hours of nutrition than rural teachers (4.2 ± 3.9 hours). Teachers at schools with fewer than 80% nonwhite students taught significantly (P = .02) more (10.4 ± 11.4 hours) compared to schools with greater than 80% nonwhite students (5.6 ± 6.4 hours).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nTeachers reported that nutrition education is important and that they are willing to teach nutrition. Efforts should be made that support integrated nutrition topics, methods of instruction, and availability of resources.",

        "abstract": "Literacy is an issue for many low-income audiences. Using visual information processing theories, the goal was improving readability of a food behavior checklist and ultimately improving its ability to accurately capture existing changes in dietary behaviors. Using group interviews, low-income clients (n = 18) evaluated 4 visual styles. The text plus color photographs style was preferred over the other 3 visual styles: text only, text plus black and white line drawings, and text plus gray-scale photographs. Employing cognitive interviewing in an iterative process, clients (n = 25) recommended simplifying text for 10 items, modifying content for 15 of 16 visuals, and replacing text with visual content for 7 of 16 items. Professional staff (n = 7) and educators (n = 10) verified that visuals and revised text accurately reflected the content of each item. Clients reported that the revised checklist captured their attention, added pleasure to the evaluation process, improved their understanding of the behaviors in question, and facilitated comprehension of text. Readability scores improved by more than 2 grades. This process can be duplicated by others interested in enhancing the quality of existing evaluation tools.",

To examine factors that influence food purchasing decisions among WIC participants, an inductive approach was used to identify themes in qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Twenty-six parents, from WIC clinics and childcare centers in the Southeast Region, participated in this study. Meal planning, store selection, price consideration, and voucher usage, all emerged as themes related to WIC food purchasing behavior among this sample.",

The intervention reduced excess gestational weight gain and was discontinued at delivery. At follow-up, 83.7% completed the 12-month assessment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with usual care, prenatal intervention had no significant effect on odds of achieving prepregnancy weight (38/128 [29.7%] vs. 41/129 [31.8%]; P = 0.98) or in reducing the magnitude of weight retained (3.3 vs. 3.1 kg; P = 0.82) at 12 months. After delivery, significant (P < 0.0001) declines in meal replacements, practice of weight control behaviors, and dietary restraint were observed in the intervention group. Independent of group, lower gestational weight gain was the strongest predictor of achieving prepregnancy weight at 12 months (P = 0.0008).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA prenatal behavioral intervention with meal replacements that reduced pregnancy weight gain had no significant effect on 12-month postpartum weight retention.",

        "abstract": "For Latinas with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels in the prediabetes and diabetes ranges, early detection can support steps to optimize their health. Data collected in 2009-2010 indicate that 36.7% of Latinas in the United States had elevated FPG levels. Latinas with elevated FPG who were unaware of their diabetes status were significantly less likely than non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black women to have seen a health care provider in the past year (75.8%, 92.9%, and 90.2%, respectively; p = .018). With almost 1 million Latinas in the United States with elevated FPG unaware of their diabetes risk, and less likely than other at-risk women to see health care providers, there is an urgent need to establish alternate sites of opportunity for their diabetes screening.",

The DGA currently provides guidelines for ages ≥ 2 y. In an effort to determine the strength of the evidence to support the inclusion of infants and children from birth to age 24 mo, the partner agencies led by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion and the USDA Center for Nutrition Program and Policy initiated the project entitled \"Evaluating the evidence base to support the inclusion of infants and children from birth to 24 months of age in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans--the B-24 Project.\" This project represents the first step in the process of applying systematic reviews to the process of deciding whether the evidence is sufficient to include this age group in future editions of the DGA. This supplement includes the B-24 Executive Summary, which describes the B-24 Project and the deliberations of the 4 working groups during the process of developing priority topics for the systematic review, and a research agenda to address the critical gaps. Also included in this supplement issue is an article on the Nutrition Evidence Library methodology for developing systematic review questions and articles from the invited content presenters at the B-24 Prime meeting.",

        "abstract": "Many factors affect the current and future practice of dietetics in the United States. This article provides an overview of the most important population risk factors and trends in health care and public policy that are anticipated to affect the current dietetics workforce and future of dietetics training and practice. It concludes with an overview of the state of the current workforce, highlighting the opportunities and challenges it will face in the future. Demographic shifts in the age and racial/ethnic composition of the US population will be a major determinant of future the dietetics profession because a growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions will require additional medical nutrition therapy services. Dietetics practitioners will work with an increasingly diverse population, which will require the ability to adapt existing programs and services to culturally diverse individuals and communities. Economic factors will affect not only the type, quantity, and quality of food available in homes, but also how health care is delivered, influencing future roles of registered dietitians (RDs) and dietetic technicians, registered (DTRs). As health care services consume a larger percentage of federal and corporate expenditures, health care agencies will continue to look for ways to reduce costs. Health promotion and disease prevention efforts will likely play a larger role in health care services, thus creating many opportunities for RDs and DTRs in preventive care and wellness. Increasingly, dietetics services will be provided in more diverse settings, such as worksites, community health centers, and home-care agencies. To address population-based health care and nutrition priorities effectively, dietetics practice will need to focus on appropriate evidence-based intervention approaches and targets. The workforce needs to be skilled in the delivery of culturally competent interventions across the lifespan, for all population groups, and across all levels of the social-ecological model for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Because there is an assumption that the dietetics profession will experience rates of attrition of 2% to 5% based on historical workforce data, an important consideration is that the current dietetics workforce is limited in terms of diversity. An increasingly diverse population will demand a more diverse dietetic workforce, which will only be achieved through a more focused effort to recruit, train, and retain practitioners from a variety of racial, ethnic, social, and cultural backgrounds. In addition, the geographic distribution of RDs and DTRs must be addressed through strategic planning efforts related to dietetics training to provide access to and delivery of services to meet population needs. Furthermore, the health care workforce is projected to bifurcate as a result of growth in demand for the \"frontline workforce\" that works in direct patient contact. This bifurcation will require the dietetics profession to consider new practice roles and the level of education and training required for these roles in relation to how much the health care delivery system is willing and able to pay for services. There are many challenges and opportunities for the dietetics workforce to address the changing population risk factors and trends in health care and public policy by working toward intervention targets across the social-ecological model to promote health, prevent disease, and eliminate health disparities. Addressing nutrition-related health needs, including controlling costs and improving health outcomes, and the demands of a changing population will require careful research and deliberation about new practice roles, integration in health care teams, workforce supply and demand, and best practices to recruit and retain a diverse workforce.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To examine the strategies and behaviors caregivers use to manage the household food supply when their children experience food insecurity as measured by the US Department of Agriculture's Household Food Security Survey Module. Design: Cross‐sectional survey with open‐ended questions collected in person. Setting: Urban and nonurban areas, South Carolina, US. Participants: Caregivers who reported food insecurity among their children (n = 746). Phenomenon of Interest: Strategies and behaviors used to manage the household food supply. Analysis: Emergent and thematic qualitative coding of open‐ended responses. Results: The top 3 strategies and behaviors to change meals were (1) changes in foods purchased or obtained for the household, (2) monetary and shopping strategies, and (3) adaptations in home preparation. The most frequently mentioned foods that were decreased were protein foods (eg, meat, eggs, beans), fruits, and vegetables. The most frequently mentioned foods that were increased were grains and starches (eg, noodles), protein foods (eg, beans, hot dogs), and mixed foods (eg, sandwiches). Conclusions and Implications: Caregivers use a wide variety of strategies and behaviors to manage the household food supply when their children are food insecure. Future work should examine how these strategies might affect dietary quality and well‐being of food‐insecure children.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association (ADA), School Nutrition Association (SNA), and Society for Nutrition Education (SNE) that comprehensive, integrated nutrition services in schools, kindergarten through grade 12, are an essential component of coordinated school health programs and will improve the nutritional status, health, and academic performance of our nation's children. Local school wellness policies may strengthen comprehensive nutrition services by encouraging multidisciplinary wellness teams, composed of school and community members, to work together in identifying local school needs, developing feasible strategies to address priority areas, and integrating comprehensive nutrition services with a coordinated school health program. This joint position paper affirms schools as an important partner in health promotion. To maximize the impact of school wellness policies on strengthening comprehensive, integrated nutrition services in schools nationwide, ADA, SNA, and SNE recommend specific strategies in the following key areas: nutrition education and promotion, food and nutrition programs available on the school campus, school-home-community partnerships, and nutrition-related health services.",

        "abstract": "The Census Bureau is partnering with state public assistance agencies to acquire program participation data and estimate new statistics that deepen a state’s understanding of program participants and improve outreach efforts to those who are eligible but do not participate. In collaboration with the Economic Research Service and the Food and Nutrition Service within the United States Department of Agriculture, the Census Bureau obtains individual-level program participation administrative records (AR) data for three state programs, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). The Census Bureau constructs a unique data set for each state program by linking the AR data to survey response data for the same individuals. These linked data enable the Census Bureau to model which survey respondents are eligible for program participation and also to observe which eligible individuals participate in the program. The Census Bureau then estimates eligibility and participation rates by a variety of demographic and economic characteristics and by county. The individual-level data also enable the Census Bureau to construct a statistical profile of eligible individuals and families that do not participate to assist state agencies with their outreach programs. All statistical results provided back to state agencies in table reports and data visualizations are reviewed to insure that individual identities are protected and not disclosed. This paper will present results for several state programs that have partnered the Census Bureau.",

        "abstract": "Background: Though eggs have the unique capacity, like breastmilk, to concentrate essential nutrients required for early growth and brain development of offspring — i.e. n-3 PUFA, increasingly deficient and sources contaminated — cholesterol and allergy concerns often exclude them from perinatal recommendations. Objective: Egg's potential contribution of key nutrients required for peak brain development are re-evaluated vis-à-vis fortification, accessibility, and risks. Methods: Contributions of standard (USDA) and fortified (selected market-available) egg compositions to perinatal requirements for critical brain-supporting nutrients were compared to human and cow milks, and risks and recommendations evaluated. Results: Standard egg has already higher concentrations/kcal of iron, selenium, zinc, choline, vitamins B12 and E, and essential amino acids (plus taurine) than human milk. Fortified egg could further yield significant n-3 PUFA %recommendations for pregnancy-lactation (total n-3 69.6–75.0% [DRI=1400−1300mg/day]), including DHA (120.1–129.3%, mostly ≈80% [calculated DRI=140−130mg/day]), plus antioxidant vitamins A (9.0–15.2%) and E (51.6–65.3%), and minerals iodine (33.6–44.5%) and selenium (33.7–39.3%); %recommendations for children (1–3 y) even more. Cholesterol, important for nerve membranes and learning, may not be generally contraindicated in childbearing-aged women (≈10.5% hypercholesterolemia), and early-life egg exposure may increase tolerance. Egg-inclusive perinatal nutrition programs have shown significant contributions. Conclusions: Eggs, especially target-fortified, may provide a unique nutritional supplement for peak brain development continously during pregnancy, nursing, and infancy (from 6 months), especially vs. insufficiencies. Missing nutritional opportunities by egg exclusion vs. concerns of hypercholesterolemia or allergy could be addressed individually, rather than as general recommendations, warranting further research and targeted egg design.",

        "abstract": "Underserved minority populations in the US Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI), Hawaii, and Alaska display disproportionate rates of childhood obesity. The region’s unique circumstance should be taken into account when designing obesity prevention interventions. The purpose of this paper is to (a), describe the community engagement process (CEP) used by the Children’s Healthy Living (CHL) Program for remote underserved minority populations in the USAPI, Hawaii, and Alaska (b) report community-identified priorities for an environmental intervention addressing early childhood (ages 2–8 years) obesity, and (c) share lessons learned in the CEP. Four communities in each of five CHL jurisdictions (Alaska, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Hawai‘i) were selected to participate in the community-randomized matched-pair trial. Over 900 community members including parents, teachers, and community leaders participated in the CEP over a 14 month period. The CEP was used to identify environmental intervention priorities to address six behavioral outcomes: increasing fruit/vegetable consumption, water intake, physical activity and sleep; and decreasing screen time and intake of sugar sweetened beverages. Community members were engaged through Local Advisory Committees, key informant interviews and participatory community meetings. Community-identified priorities centered on policy development; role modeling; enhancing access to healthy food, clean water, and physical activity venues; and healthy living education. Through the CEP, CHL identified culturally appropriate priorities for intervention that were also consistent with the literature on effective obesity prevention practices. Results of the CEP will guide the CHL intervention design and implementation. The CHL CEP may serve as a model for other underserved minority island populations.",

Kentucky WIC program management information system data from 2012 to 2013 was explored through a retrospective cohort study. Audience segmentation identified unique groups with respect to nonparticipation. Presumptive eligibility for Medicaid was the strongest predictor of nonparticipation. Among those who were not presumptively eligible, women who were the only ones in their households enrolled in the program were at higher risk of nonparticipation. Outreach strategies at the point of enrollment or when presumptive eligibility for Medicaid is granted could mitigate further nonparticipation.",

Local school wellness policies may strengthen comprehensive nutrition services by encouraging multidisciplinary wellness teams, composed of school and community members, to work together in identifying local school needs, developing feasible strategies to address priority areas, and integrating comprehensive nutrition services with a coordinated school health program. This joint position paper affirms schools as an important partner in health promotion. To maximize the impact of school wellness policies on strengthening comprehensive, integrated nutrition services in schools nationwide, ADA, SNA, and SNE recommend specific strategies in the following key areas: nutrition education and promotion, food and nutrition programs available on the school campus, school-home-community partnerships, and nutrition-related health services.",

Overweight has increased, whereas saturated fat and cholesterol intake have decreased, at least as percentage of total caloric intake. Better understanding of children's cardiovascular risk status and current diet is available from national survey data. New research on the efficacy of diet intervention in children has been published. Also, increasing attention has been paid to the importance of nutrition early in life, including the fetal milieu. This scientific statement summarizes current available information on cardiovascular nutrition in children and makes recommendations for both primordial and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease beginning at a young age.",

        "abstract": "The Food & Fitness (F&F) community partnerships, funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation from 2007 to 2016, were established to create community-determined change in the conditions that affect health and health equity in neighborhoods. The focus of the work has been to increase access to locally grown good food (food that is healthy, sustainable, fair, and affordable), and safe places for physical activity for children and families in communities with inequities across the United States through changes in policies, community infrastructure, and systems at the local level. This article describes the outcomes related to systems and policy change over 9 years of community change efforts in the F&F partnerships. Characteristics of the F&F communities where the work took place; the change model that emerged from the work; efforts and changes achieved related to community food, school food, and active living/built environment; overall factors in the community that helped or hindered the work of the partnerships; and a depiction of the community-determined process for change employed by the partnerships are described. Local systems and policy change is a long-term process. Community-determined efforts that build capacity for systems change, commitment to long-term funding, and provision of technical assistance tailored to community needs were elements that contributed to success in the F&F work. Achieving intermediate outcomes on the road to policy and systems change created a way to monitor success and make midcourse corrections when needed.",

        "abstract": "We examine the effect of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) on the quality of household food purchases using the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) and propensity score matching. A healthy purchasing index (HPI) is used to measure nutritional quality of household food purchases. WIC foods explain the improvement in quality of food purchases, not self-selection of more nutrition-conscious households into the program. The improvement in purchase quality was driven entirely by WIC participating households who redeemed WIC foods during the interview week. There was no significant difference between WIC-participants who did not redeem WIC foods and eligible non-participants. In this sample, there is no evidence that lack of access to clinics has adverse effects on participation nor is there evidence that HPI depends on supermarket access. A supervised machine learning process supports our main conclusion on the importance of WIC foods.",

        "abstract": "Childhood obesity is a major health problem. Effective strategies are necessary to promote healthy eating in toddlers. The Nutrition Education Aimed at Toddlers project examined rural, low-income caregivers' knowledge, attitudes, mealtime practices, and dietary intake before and after a nutrition program. A convenience sample of 38 families participated in the study; 19 attended classes, and 19 did not. Six months after the lessons, no significant differences were found between groups; however, the resultant dietary, feeding knowledge, attitudinal, and behavioral data provide a valuable description regarding a hard to reach, high-risk population. However, caregivers' perceptions about feeding their toddlers differed from their reported dietary intakes of dairy, fruits, and vegetables. It appears that knowledge is insufficient to change eating habits. Identification of the issues that prevent caregivers in providing proper feeding is needed for a lasting change of eating habits.",

        "abstract": "Residents of environmental justice (EJ) communities may bear a disproportionate burden of environmental health risk, and often face additional burdens from social determinants of health. Accounting for cumulative risk should include measures of risk from both environmental sources and social determinants. This study sought to better understand cumulative health risk from both social and environmental sources in a disadvantaged community in Texas. Key outcomes were determining what data are currently available for this assessment, clarifying data needs, identifying data gaps, and considering how those gaps could be filled. Analyses suggested that the traditionally defined EJ community in Port Arthur may have a lower environmental risk from air toxics than the rest of the City of Port Arthur (although the entire city has a higher risk than the average for the state), but may have a larger burden from social determinants of health. However, the results should be interpreted in light of the availability of data, the definitions of community boundaries, and the areal unit utilized. Continued focus on environmental justice communities and the cumulative risks faced by their residents is critical to protecting these residents and, ultimately, moving towards a more equitable distribution and acceptable level of risk throughout society.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between increased Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits following the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and the diet quality of individuals from SNAP-eligible compared to ineligible (those with somewhat higher income) households using data from the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The ARRA increased SNAP monthly benefits by 13.6% of the maximum allotment for a given household size, equivalent to an increase of $24 to $144 for one-to-eight person households respectively. In the full sample, we find that these increases in SNAP benefits are not associated with changes in nutrient intake and diet quality. However, among those with no more than a high school education, higher SNAP benefits are associated with a 46% increase in the mean caloric share from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and a decrease in overall diet quality especially for those at the lower end of the diet quality distribution, amounting to a 9% decline at the 25th percentile.",

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) uses an auction to procure infant formula. Manufacturers bid on the right to be an agency’s sole supplier by offering a rebate on formula sold through WIC. Agencies frequently join together in buyer alliances. An empirical estimation shows that bids are lower to alliances and that lower prices result because alliances are heterogeneous. Results suggest that when heterogeneity is not controlled, bids decline with alliance size, which has policy implications because Congress recently limited alliance size.",

Issues discussed included the state of the science, such as what health economic methods are currently used to judge the burden of illness, interventions, or healthcare policies, and what new research methodologies are available or needed to address knowledge and methodological gaps or barriers. Research applications included existing evidence-based health economic research activities in nutrition that are ongoing or planned at federal agencies. International and US regulatory, policy, and clinical practice perspectives included a discussion of how research results can help regulators and policy makers within government make nutrition policy decisions, and how economics affects clinical guideline development.",

Fifty-nine (urban, n = 27; rural, n = 32) adults. The sample was of mixed race and had a range of incomes. Almost half of the sample was obese.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nFood systems access and the role of community infrastructure, civic engagement, and reciprocal relationships in food provisioning in counties with different urban influence codes.\n\n\nANALYSES\nThemes and subthemes were identified through emerging concepts.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFood access varied based on rurality and community infrastructure. Three themes emerged: community infrastructure around the conventional food system and food provisioning, alternative food resources, and perceptions of the effect food and of the influence diet and exercise have on health.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nCivic engagement and community infrastructure affected food access. Rural residents rely more on retail grocery stores, gardening, hunting, and informal food exchange systems, whereas urban residents rely more on the retail grocery stores and food safety net systems. Hunting and gardening may contribute valuable nutrients to the diet.",

Secondary analysis of 1994 data from public documents and agencies for the 50 states was conducted. Independent variables were ratio of the federal WIC grant to the eligible population, state supplementation of WIC, administrative and food dollars per person, WIC population per clinic, and WIC priority categories served. The dependent variable was the eligible WIC population enrolled. State supplementation of the WIC budget, administrative and food dollars per person, cost of living, population density, population distribution, and ratio of the federal WIC grant to the eligible population accounted for 85% of variance in WIC enrollment. Policy recommendations include reorienting the federal funding formula toward incentives for enrollment, state supplementation of WIC, and examination of administrative and food costs.",

Cost-benefit ratios estimated from costs and monetized benefits. Sensitivity analyses provided ranges where lack of agreement exists around parameters' values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCost was $892/graduate. Cost-effectiveness was 245 QALYs saved, at $20863/QALY (sensitivity 42-935 QALYs, $5467-$130311 per QALY). Societal willingness to pay benefit-to-cost ratio was $9.58:$1.00 (sensitivity $1.44-$41.92:$1:00); narrow governmental benefit-to-cost ratio was $0.82:$1.00 (sensitivity $0.08-$4.33:$1:00).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nOutcome data indicate that food and nutrition behavior changes resulting from the Program are likely to improve future health and reduce health care costs. Cost-effectiveness is estimated to be as great as for many current health interventions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The importance of breastmilk as a primary preventative intervention is widely known and understood by most healthcare providers. The actions or non-actions that heathcare providers take toward promoting and supporting breastfeeding families make a difference in the success and duration of breastfeeding. Recognizing this relationship, the World Health Organization developed the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (the Code), which defines best practices in breastfeeding promotion, including physicians' offices. The pediatric practices' waiting rooms are often a family's first experience with pediatric care. The specific aims of this study were to describe (1) Code compliance, (2) the demographic factors affecting the Code compliance, and (3) the amount and type of breastfeeding-supportive materials available in the pediatricians' waiting rooms. An observational cross-sectional design was used to collect data from 163 (82%) of the pediatric practices in Maricopa County, Arizona. None of the 100 waiting rooms that had any materials displayed (61%) was found to be completely Code compliant, with 81 of the offices having formula-promotional materials readily available. Waiting rooms in higher income areas offered more non-Code-compliant materials and gifts. Breastfeeding support information and materials were lacking in all but 18 (18%) offices. A positive relationship (t97=-2.31, p=0.02) occurred between the presence of breastfeeding educational materials and higher income areas. We were able to uncover some practice-related patterns that impact families and potentially undermine breastfeeding success. To move current practices toward breastfeeding-friendly physicians' offices, change is needed.",

        "abstract": "Although the term \"whole grain\" is well defined, there has been no universal standard of what constitutes a \"whole-grain food,\" creating challenges for researchers, the food industry, regulatory authorities, and consumers around the world. As part of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Technical Advisory Committee issued a call to action to develop definitions for whole-grain foods that could be universally accepted and applied to dietary recommendations and planning. The Committee's call to action, and the lack of a global whole-grain food definition, was the impetus for the Whole Grain Roundtable held 3-5 December 2012 in Chicago, Illinois. The objective was to develop a whole-grain food definition that is consistent with the quartet of needs of science, food product formulation, consumer behavior, and label education. The roundtable's expert panel represented a broad range of expertise from the United States and Europe, including epidemiology and dietary intervention researchers, consumer educators, government policy makers, and food and nutrition scientists from academia and the grain food industry. Taking into account the totality, quality, and consistency of available scientific evidence, the expert panel recommended that 8 g of whole grain/30 g serving (27 g/100 g), without a fiber requirement, be considered a minimum content of whole grains that is nutritionally meaningful and that a food providing at least 8 g of whole grains/30-g serving be defined as a whole-grain food. Having an established whole-grain food definition will encourage manufacturers to produce foods with meaningful amounts of whole grain, allow consistent product labeling and messaging, and empower consumers to readily identify whole-grain foods and achieve whole-grain dietary recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Determine the impact of Cooking Matters for Adults (CM) on food resource management (FRM) skills and self‐confidence 6 months after course completion. Design: Quasi‐experimental design with nonequivalent comparison group and 6‐month follow‐up. Setting: Cooking Matters for Adults programs in CA, CO, ME, MA, MI, and OR. Participants: Participants in CM attending classes in April to July, 2016 (n = 332); comparison group (n = 336). Intervention: Cooking Matters for Adults educated low‐income adults to shop for and prepare healthy meals economically using hands‐on meal preparation, facilitated discussion, and an interactive grocery store tour. Classes met for 2 hours, once a week for 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measure(s): Food resource management practices; FRM self‐confidence (ie, in shopping for and preparing healthy foods on a budget); worrying that food might run out. Analysis: Pearson's chi‐square test and t tests identified measures associated with outcomes of interest and between‐group differences. Repeated‐measures linear mixed models with fixed and random effects were used to examine differences in outcomes between participants in CM and nonequivalent comparison group and to estimate the treatment effect of the program at 3 and 6 months after course completion. Results: Six months after course completion, CM participants demonstrated improvements in all outcome measures of interest: Use of FRM practices improved (P = .002) as did FRM confidence (P < .001). Participants also worried less that food would run out before they had money to buy more (P = .03). Conclusions and Implications: This study demonstrated a positive impact of including FRM skills and confidence building in a nutrition education program, the effects of which could be seen for 6 months after participation in the program. Equipping low‐income families with FRM skills allowed them to access healthier foods even during times of hardship.",

To examine factors that influence food purchasing decisions among WIC participants, an inductive approach was used to identify themes in qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Twenty-six parents, from WIC clinics and childcare centers in the Southeast Region, participated in this study. Meal planning, store selection, price consideration, and voucher usage, all emerged as themes related to WIC food purchasing behavior among this sample.",

To examine factors that influence food purchasing decisions among WIC participants, an inductive approach was used to identify themes in qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Twenty-six parents, from WIC clinics and childcare centers in the Southeast Region, participated in this study. Meal planning, store selection, price consideration, and voucher usage, all emerged as themes related to WIC food purchasing behavior among this sample.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Recent findings show that national childhood obesity prevalence overall is improving among some age groups, but that disparities continue to persist, particularly among populations that have historically been at higher risk of obesity and overweight. Over the past several years, many jurisdictions at the city or county level across the nation have also reported declines. Little evaluation has focused on understanding the factors that influence the implementation of efforts to reduce childhood obesity rates. This article summarizes the rationale, aims, and overall design of the Childhood Obesity Declines Project (COBD), which was the first of its kind to systematically study and document the what, how, when, and where of community-based obesity strategies in four distinct communities across the nation. Methods: COBD was initiated by the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research (NCCOR), was led by a subset of NCCOR advisors and a research team at ICF, and was guided by exter...",

A brief review of existing national nutrition surveys and studies of infants and toddlers, and available study designs and dietary methods, is also included.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/SETTING\nMost national studies have been cross-sectional and assessed breastfeeding rates, dietary intake, and nutritional status among general and high-risk populations. Other specialized studies have been longitudinal and tracked dietary intake and nutritional status from infancy to the preschool years, or focused on studying a specific research topic, such as the relationship between fluoride intake and dental caries.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study has advanced the knowledge base on infant and toddler nutrition by using state-of-the-art methodology and by providing researchers with updated information to develop further research questions. Our findings can be used by child health and nutrition organizations to develop dietary recommendations and improved nutrition education materials. Clinicians and practitioners in the fields of public health and wellness can use the information to provide practical advice to parents in a variety of settings to help give children a more healthful start.",

        "abstract": "By October 2009, all 50 states had implemented a revised WIC program with produce \n vouchers for millions of eligible families. USDA economists had projected the vouchers \n would raise net farm revenues by $76 million. In response to such a significant policy \n change and market opportunity, a UC Agriculture and Natural Resources Cooperative \n Extension team of researchers conducted a pilot project to test the ability of small \n farms to market produce locally to WIC-authorized stores known as A-50 vendors. They \n also interviewed store owners and produce distributors to determine how produce was \n entering the supply chain to the A-50 vendors. The pilot project was not successful \n in helping small growers enter the supply chain. The analysis indicates that it is \n improbable that small farms will be selling much produce to A-50 vendors; growers’ \n price expectations are unlikely to be met since these vendors are competing with large \n retailers. And although the vouchers can be redeemed at farmers markets, very few \n are because the process is cumbersome for growers and shoppers.",

        "abstract": "Nutrient profiling of foods, described as the science of ranking foods based on their nutrient content, is fast becoming the basis for regulating nutrition labels, health claims, and marketing and advertising to children. A number of nutrient profile models have now been developed by research scientists, regulatory agencies, and by the food industry. Whereas some of these models have focused on nutrients to limit, others have emphasized nutrients known to be beneficial to health, or some combination of both. Although nutrient profile models are often tailored to specific goals, the development process ought to follow the same science-driven rules. These include the selection of index nutrients and reference amounts, the development of an appropriate algorithm for calculating nutrient density, and the validation of the chosen nutrient profile model against healthy diets. It is extremely important that nutrient profiles be validated rather than merely compared to prevailing public opinion. Regulatory agencies should act only when they are satisfied that the scientific process has been followed, that the algorithms are transparent, and that the profile model has been validated with respect to objective measures of a healthy diet.",

        "abstract": "Evidence shows that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is underutilized. WIC enrolls only sixty percent of eligible persons. Participants claim only a fraction of available benefits. Researchers suggest that people underutilize WIC because of the time needed to enroll in and use WIC and because participants may believe that, if others notice them participating in WIC, community members will stigmatize them. Recently enacted policies may reduce both time costs and potential for stigma associated with WIC. Congress mandated that, by 2020, all states disburse WIC benefits through an Electronic Benefits Transfer (eWIC) system. The eWIC potentially reduces the time required for each transaction and makes it more difficult to identify beneficiaries. We analyze data on grocery expenditures of 11,887 WIC-participating households in one state over the period it implemented eWIC. We find that, after beneficiaries began redeeming WIC benefits through eWIC, spending on non-WIC eligible foods did not change but redemptions of WIC benefits increased.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nResearch consistently shows that the majority of American children do not consume diets that meet the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, nor do they achieve adequate levels of daily physical activity. As a result, more children are overweight today than at any other time in U.S. history. Schools offer many opportunities to develop strategies to prevent obesity by creating environments in which children eat healthfully and engage regularly in physical activity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis article discusses the role of schools in obesity prevention efforts. Current issues in schools' food and physical activity environments are examined, as well as federal, state, and local policies related to food and physical activity standards in schools. The article is organized around four key areas: (1) school food environments and policies, (2) school physical activity environments and policies, (3) school body mass index measurements, and (4) school wellness policies. Recommendations for accelerating change also are addressed.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThe article found that (1) competitive foods (foods sold outside of federally reimbursed school meals) are widely available in schools, especially secondary schools. Studies have related the availability of snacks and drinks sold in schools to students' high intake of total calories, soft drinks, total fat and saturated fat, and lower intake of fruits and vegetables; (2) physical activity can be added to the school curriculum without academic consequences and also can offer physical, emotional, and social benefits. Policy leadership has come predominantly from the districts, then the states, and, to a much lesser extent, the federal government; (3) few studies have examined the effectiveness or impact of school-based BMI measurement programs; and (4) early comparative analyses of local school wellness policies suggest that the strongest policies are found in larger school districts and districts with a greater number of students eligible for a free or reduced-price lunch.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nStudies show that schools have been making some progress in improving the school food and physical activity environments but that much more work is needed. Stronger policies are needed to provide healthier meals to students at schools; limit their access to low-nutrient, energy-dense foods during the school day; and increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of physical activity at school.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy has been recognized as a period of special nutritional needs across cultures and for many generations. Mothers who have adequate food and good quality nutritional intake generally have better birth outcomes. In cultures where food is scarce, pregnant women may be given extra servings­ of high quality protein items such as eggs or milk or other scarce but nutritious foods when there isn’t sufficient supply for everyone to consume them. However, formal programs to improve ­women’s nutrition during pregnancy as a strategy to improve birth outcomes are relatively recent. This is ­particularly the case in industrialized countries such as the United States where chronic undernutrition is not endemic. This chapter examines the evidence base for programs that seek to improve birth outcomes through improving pregnant women’s nutritional intake and nutrition ­education. It begins with a brief overview of the role of nutrition in pregnancy, followed by a discussion of the foundation for WIC, the major U.S. prenatal nutrition intervention. A critical evaluation is then presented of the evidence for WIC and selected other programs in reducing low birth weight (LBW) and in reducing racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the findings for practitioners along with suggestions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Many states including California allow fruit and vegetable checks (FVCs) issued by the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program to be redeemed at farmers’ markets. Despite the potential of the FVC program to increase the revenue of participating farmers and to provide fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables to WIC participants, analysis of data for California shows that redemptions of FVCs at farmers’ markets have to date been miniscule. We study the barriers to use of FVCs at farmers’ markets and consider strategies for expanding both farmer and WIC client participation in the farmers’ market program. Our methodology involved design, implementation and analysis of surveys of both farmers’ market managers and farmer vendors who participate in the program and analysis of the behavior of WIC participants through California WIC program redemption data. One major factor limiting redemptions in California is that relatively few farmers’ markets currently accept FVCs and both market managers and farmers report that the authorization process is onerous. WIC participants who shopped at authorized markets more fully utilized the fixed-dollar value of their voucher, compared with participants who shopped at other authorized WIC vendors. Nevertheless, participants who visited a farmers’ market are unlikely to return. The study concludes with suggested pathways to increase WIC participant utilization of farmers’ markets.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to describe the extent and locations of soft drink advertisements on high school campuses in Pennsylvania and identify factors related to extent of these advertisements. Surveys were distributed to 271 school foodservice directors in a random sample of high schools in Pennsylvania. These high schools were selected to be representative of the entire population of high schools in Pennsylvania based on chosen demographic characteristics. A three-phase survey strategy was used, involving distribution of a postcard reminder 1 to 2 weeks after the initial survey distribution, and mailing of a second survey to nonrespondents 1 to 2 weeks after mailing of the postcard. Two hundred twenty-eight school foodservice directors (84%) returned surveys. Linear multiple regression analyses were done using SPSS (version 11.5.1, 2002, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Approximately two thirds (66.5%) of respondents indicated soft drink advertisements exist in at least one location in their school, with the most prevalent locations being on vending machines (62%) and school grounds, such as playing fields (27%). Slightly more than 10% of respondents indicated soft drink advertisements displayed in the cafeteria. Extent of soft drink advertisement locations was positively related to existence of a pouring-rights contract, subscription to Channel One, and receipt of incentives from soft drink bottlers based on sales, but negatively related to average daily participation in school lunch. These findings suggest that commercialization and sales incentives might interact to contribute to school environments that are not \"nutrition-friendly.\" Schools' efforts to establish wellness policies as mandated by the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 provide ideal opportunities to examine school environments for advertising that might conflict with the healthful environments they are aiming to establish, and perhaps to develop policies to address these practices.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPersons accessing food from nonprofit distribution sites face numerous challenges and typically have significant unmet health needs. However, given limited and intermittent healthcare system engagement, this vulnerable population is underrepresented in clinical research. We sought to better understand the health needs of a nonclinical population to inform future research and interventions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFocus groups were conducted in English (n = 4) and Spanish (n = 4) with clients of Crossroads Community Services (CCS), the largest distributor of North Texas Food Bank. Discussions probed participants' health status, healthcare utilization, understanding and utilization of mammography, and attitudes toward participation in research.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants included 42 CCS clients, primarily Hispanic or African American women. Participants reported multiple comorbid conditions among household members, yet utilization of health services was often limited by cost. The majority expressed interest in participating in research to communicate their health concerns and obtain emotional support.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCCS clients represent a high-need, under-reached population willing to engage in health-related research that affords them opportunity to connect with peers in group settings and obtain information to improve management of daily life challenges. The Community Assistance Research (CARe) Initiative, a community-academic collaboration, establishes a much-needed opportunity for ongoing clinical research and intervention among this underserved population.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate factors affecting food choice and health beliefs among low-income women in the context of their weight and socioeconomic status.\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwo researchers conducted 14 90-minute focus groups, which were audiotaped.\n\n\nSETTING\nLibraries, homeless shelters, and a community center.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nNinety-two low-income women (18-65 years) with at least 1 child aged 9-13 years in the household.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nFood choice and health beliefs of low-income women.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nTranscripts were coded and reconciled; common themes and subthemes were identified.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver 75% of participants were overweight/obese (body mass index [BMI] > or = 25), and most were in charge of purchasing and preparing food for their families. Health concerns included diabetes, hypertension, and overweight/obesity, and most felt their health status had genetic or metabolic origins. Although many would like to regularly consume healthful food (eg, fresh fruits and vegetables), such food was perceived as unaffordable.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nA disconnect between diet and health among low-income women calls for nutrition interventions that educate low-income families on inexpensive, healthful eating in a structured environment, and diet-disease relationships. Changes at a policy level should be considered to increase affordability and accessibility of healthful food in low-income neighborhoods and through federal food assistance programs.",

        "abstract": "The dietetics profession faces many workforce challenges and opportunities to ensure that registered dietitians (RDs) and dietetic technicians, registered (DTRs) are at the forefront of health and nutrition. The profession must prepare for new public priorities, changes in population, and the restructuring of how people learn and work, as well as new advances in science and technology. In September 2010, the Dietetics Workforce Demand Task Force, in consultation with a panel of thought leaders, identified 10 change drivers that affect dietetics workforce supply and demand. This future scan report provides an overview of eight of these drivers. Two change drivers-health care reform and population risk factors/nutrition initiatives-are addressed in separate technical articles. A change matrix has been included at the end of this executive summary. The matrix contains a summary of each change driver and its expected impact and is designed to present the drivers in the context of a larger, dynamic system of change in the dietetics profession. The impact of any of these change drivers individually and collectively in a dynamic system is uncertain. The outcome of any change driver is also uncertain. The dietetics profession faces many choices within each change driver to meet the workforce challenges and seize the opportunities for leadership and growth.",

Since the publication of the DRI reports 1997-2004, the reference intake levels have been used for various purposes. While DRIs have been used appropriately for planning and assessing diets for many different situations, there have been instances in which specific DRI categories have not been applied as intended. In this review, cases are described in which DRIs were applied correctly, as well as cases from the growing number of examples in which the wrong DRI was used or DRIs were used incorrectly.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo perform comparative validity testing for a bilingual interactive multimedia (IMM) dietary assessment tool that mimics a dietary recall against an interview-administered dietary recall.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a two-period crossover design study. First, participants were randomly assigned to complete an IMM recall or interview-administered 24-hour recall. The IMM recall generated a nutrient profile that included 20 dietary constituents. The interview-administered recall was analyzed using the Food Intake Analysis System (FIAS) and the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) Evaluating/Reporting System. The effect of substituting standardized portion sizes for reported portion sizes was examined.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/SETTING\nOf 80 adult participants, 71 (91%) were female, 45 (56%) had 12th grade or less education, 65 (81%) had an annual income of dollar 15,000 or less, and 21 (26%) completed the IMM recall in Spanish.\n\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED\nAnalysis of variance and unadjusted and energy-adjusted correlations were used.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant group differences were found for order of administration or demographic characteristics. There was only one significant (P=.025) method effect, whereby vitamin C intake was higher in the IMM recall than the FIAS. The unadjusted correlations between the IMM recalls and interview-administered recalls analyzed using both FIAS and EFNEP Evaluating/Reporting System were generally approximately 0.6. Energy-adjusted correlations were consistently lower. Substituting standardized portion sizes resulted in significant differences for six nutrients and caused all correlations to decrease.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe IMM dietary recall is a valid method for assessing dietary intake within the tested group. The results of comparative validity testing and positive reactions received from participants and nutrition educators indicate that diet assessment using IMM has tremendous potential.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nInsufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables in childhood increases the risk of future chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of fruit, vegetables or both amongst children aged five years and under.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase to identify eligible trials on 30 September 2016. We searched CINAHL and PsycINFO in July 2016, Proquest Dissertations and Theses in November 2016 and three clinical trial registers in November 2016 and June 2017. We reviewed reference lists of included trials and handsearched three international nutrition journals. We contacted authors of included studies to identify further potentially relevant trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials, including cluster-randomised controlled trials and cross-over trials, of any intervention primarily targeting consumption of fruit, vegetables or both among children aged five years and under, and incorporating a dietary or biochemical assessment of fruit or vegetable consumption. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of identified papers; a third review author resolved disagreements.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies; a third review author resolved disagreements. Due to unexplained heterogeneity, we used random-effects models in meta-analyses for the primary review outcomes where we identified sufficient trials. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) to account for the heterogeneity of fruit and vegetable consumption measures.We conducted assessments of risks of bias and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE approach) using Cochrane procedures.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 50 trials with 137 trial arms and 10,267 participants. Thirty trials examined the impact of child-feeding practices (e.g. repeated food exposure) in increasing child vegetable intake. Eleven trials examined the impact of parent nutrition education in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. Eight studies examined the impact of multicomponent interventions (e.g. parent nutrition education and preschool policy changes) in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake. One study examined the effect of a nutrition intervention delivered to children in increasing child fruit and vegetable intake.Thirteen of the 50 included trials were judged as free from high risks of bias across all domains; performance, detection and attrition bias were the most common domains judged at high risk of bias of remaining studies.Meta-analysis of trials examining child-feeding practices versus no intervention revealed a positive effect on child vegetable consumption (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61; n = 1509; 11 studies; very low-quality evidence), equivalent to a mean difference of 4.03 grams of vegetables. There were no short-term differences in child consumption of fruit and vegetables in meta-analyses of trials examining parent nutrition education versus no intervention (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.28; n = 3023; 10 studies; very low-quality evidence) or multicomponent interventions versus no intervention (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.63; n = 1861; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence).Insufficient data were available to assess long-term effectiveness, cost effectiveness and unintended adverse consequences of interventions.Studies reported receiving governmental or charitable funds, except for two studies reporting industry funding.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nDespite identifying 50 eligible trials of various intervention approaches, the evidence for how to increase fruit and vegetable consumption of children remains sparse. There was very low-quality evidence child-feeding practice interventions are effective in increasing vegetable consumption of children aged five years and younger, however the effect size was very small and long-term follow-up is required. There was very low-quality evidence that parent nutrition education and multicomponent interventions are not effective in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption of children aged five years and younger. All findings should be considered with caution, given most included trials could not be combined in meta-analyses. Given the very low-quality evidence, future research will very likely change estimates and conclusions. Such research should adopt more rigorous methods to advance the field.This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

Findings indicate that disadvantaged consumers living on the lower eastside of Detroit, Michigan bypass their neighborhood food environments, which are disproportionately composed of convenience and party stores, to shop at independent, discount and regional supermarkets located in other parts of the city and in the suburbs. These trends hold despite various economic and physical constraints to their mobility. These findings complicate past assumptions that socially and economically disadvantaged residents living in a food desert shop within their neighborhood environment.",

Food and water and nutritional well-being are essential to the health, self-sufficiency, and quality of life for the fast growing, heterogeneous, multiracial, and ethnic populations of older adults. Many people, as they age, remain fully independent and actively engaged in their communities; however, others fare less well and need more support. A broad array of appropriate, culturally sensitive food and nutrition services, physical activities, and health and supportive care customized to the population of older adults are necessary. National, state, and local policies that promote coordination and integration of food and nutrition services into health and supportive systems are needed to maintain independence, functional ability, chronic disease management, and quality of life. Dietetics professionals can take the lead by researching and developing national, state, and local collaborative networks to incorporate effectively the food and nutrition services across the spectrum of aging.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe authors conducted a study of dental services used by women of childbearing age who were enrolled in Medicaid in Oregon during the early 2000s, a period of reform during which health care coverage was expanded. They compared claims for pregnant women, women who were not pregnant and had children and women who were not pregnant and did not have children. They also compared differences in claims between those for women enrolled in managed care and those for women enrolled in fee-for-service plans.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors computed the proportion of women for whom a dental claim was submitted in six-month spans for 2000, 2001, 2002 (before reform) and 2005 (after reform).\n\n\nRESULTS\nBefore and after reforms, the mean utilization rate for pregnant women, adjusted for the proportion of the period covered, decreased from 0.36 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.025) to 0.22 (SD = 0.028). Among women who were not pregnant and had children, the average adjusted rates decreased from 0.49 (SD = 0.201) to 0.21 (SD = 0.078). The pattern was similar among women who had no dependent children: rates decreased from 0.50 (SD = 0.028) to 0.19 (SD = 0.078). Most of the claims were for diagnostic services. The authors found no differences between women enrolled in managed care and those enrolled in fee-for-service plans.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nContrary to their intention, health care reforms in Oregon were detrimental to the vulnerable populations that Medicaid is intended to serve.\n\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nDental care is important for maternal and child health. However, utilization is unlikely to improve without changes in Medicaid and the dental care delivery system.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nA diet high in fruits and vegetables (FV) is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease. One strategy to incentivize FV consumption among low-income households is to make them more affordable through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This study aims to identify the cost effectiveness of subsidizing FV purchases among the one in seven Americans who participate in SNAP.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a societal perspective to estimate lifetime costs and health gains associated with subsidizing FV purchases. A stochastic microsimulation model of obesity, type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction, and stroke in the 2015 U.S. population was used. Model parameters were based on nationally representative SNAP participation and dietary consumption data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2012), and data from a randomized trial of FV subsidies among SNAP users.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDespite cycling of participants in and out of SNAP, expanding an FV subsidy nationwide through SNAP would be expected to reduce incidence of type 2 diabetes by 1.7% (95% CI=1.2, 2.2), myocardial infarction by 1.4% (95% CI=0.9, 1.9), stroke by 1.2% (95% CI=0.8, 1.6), and obesity by 0.2% (95% CI=0.1, 0.3), and be cost saving from a societal perspective. The saved costs would be largely attributable to long-term reductions in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe model suggests nationwide SNAP FV subsidies would reduce chronic disease morbidity, mortality, and costs over long time horizons that are unlikely to be observed in short-term community-based trials.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn 2004, Congress passed legislation mandating that all public school districts participating in federal school meal programs develop a school wellness policy (SWP) to direct efforts related to nutrition and physical activity. We examined the extent to which SWPs varied in comprehensiveness and strength in a representative sample of school districts in the southeastern United States, the area of the country with the highest rates of childhood obesity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPolicies were assessed using an established 96-item coding tool by 2 raters to ascertain the comprehensiveness and strength of the policies as a whole, and across distinct subsections specified by federal legislation. In addition, variability in SWP comprehensiveness and strength was assessed based on district sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, SWPs in the southeastern states are weakly written, fragmented, and lack requirements necessary for healthy school environments. District size, which was the only sociodemographic factor related to policy characteristics, yielded an inverse association.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo encourage continued promotion of healthy school environments, school districts will require technical support to improve the quality of their school wellness policies.",

The objectives of this review are to summarize research on state and local policies germane to weight-related health equity among young children in the United States and on how federal policies and regulations may provide supports for child-care providers serving families with the most limited resources. In addition, a third objective is to comprehensively review studies of whether there are differences in practices and policies within US child-care facilities according to the location or demographics of providers and children. The review found there is growing evidence addressing disparities in the social and physical child-care environments provided for young children, but scientific gaps are present in the current understanding of how resources should best be allocated and policies designed to promote health equity. Additional research is needed to address limitations of prior studies relating to the measurement of supports for weight-related health; complexities of categorizing socioeconomic position, ethnicity/race, and urban and rural areas; exclusion of legally nonlicensed care settings from most research; and the cross-sectional nature of most study designs. There is a particularly great need for the development of strong surveillance systems to allow for better monitoring and evaluation of state policies that may impact weight-related aspects of child-care environments, implementation at the program level, and needed implementation supports.",

Methods: The researchers analyzed clinic‐based, fruit/vegetable prescription program data for 578 low‐income families, collected in 2013–2015, and calculated changes in food security (summative score; high/low/very low; and individual US Department of Agriculture measures). Results: Of participating households, 72% increased their summative score over the course of the program. In adjusted regression models, participants had higher change scores with 5 or 6 clinical visits, compared with 1 or 2 visits (&bgr; = .07; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.14), and college education of the primary caretaker, compared with less than college (&bgr; = .05; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.09). Select clinic sites (but neither visit nor redemption proportions) significantly contributed to change score variance. All US Department of Agriculture measures saw significant increases. Conclusions and Implications: Fruit/vegetable prescription programs may help providers address patients' food insecurity. Further research using experimental designs and implementation science could build the case to incorporate programs into practice.",

        "abstract": "Decision rules are at the heart of federal grant allocations that presume funds will go where the need is. Federal grant administrators are under mandates to do effective, efficient, and responsive \"relative need\" program benefit targeting, explicitly defined in justifiable decision rules. Using a case study of the Special Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), we follow the definition of relative need to a final national funding strategy for state agency WICgrant allocations. Comparing the funding effects and the subsequent perceptions of stakeholders, we found that formulating decision rules to operationalize equity, responsiveness, and efficiency in a national funding formula is fraught with problems. These included data limitations, differing stakeholder views of the proper selection and weighting of need indicators, barriers to a smooth transition to a newfunding method, and raised expectations that \"hard\" data will result in truly rational allocations.",

        "abstract": "\"Despite the benefits of prenatal participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), many eligible women either do not participate or begin participation late in their pregnancies. Using recent nationally representative data, we find that more disadvantaged women are more likely to access WIC and, with some notable exceptions, to participate earlier in their pregnancies. Hispanic women, especially those with language difficulties, enroll in WIC later in their pregnancies. Early WIC participation, particularly among teenagers, is less likely among women experiencing a first birth and depends on the mother's early recognition of her pregnancy. \"(\"JEL \"I18, I30) Copyright (c) 2008 Western Economic Association International.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE\nChildren of Mexican descent frequently experience household food insecurity both in the United States and Mexico. However, little is known about the associations of food insecurity with dietary intake. This study aimed to understand the level of perceived food insecurity and its association with dietary intake among children of Mexican descent residing in the United States and Mexico.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis cross-sectional study utilized data from a 2006 binational study of 5-year-old children of Mexican descent living in migrant communities in California and Mexico.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn California, children were 301 participants from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas study, a longitudinal birth cohort in a Mexican immigrant community. Mexican children (n=301) were participants in the Proyecto Mariposa study, which was designed to capture a sample of women and their children living in Mexico who closely resembled the California sample, yet who never migrated to the United States. Household food insecurity was measured using the US Department of Agriculture Food Security Scale and dietary intake was assessed with food frequency questionnaires. Analysis of variance was used to examine unadjusted and adjusted differences in total energy, nutrient intake, and consumption of food groups by household food security status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately 39% of California mothers and 75% of Mexico mothers reported low or very low food security in the past 12 months (P<0.01). Children in the United States experiencing food insecurity consumed more fat, saturated fat, sweets, and fried snacks than children not experiencing food insecurity. In contrast, in Mexico food insecurity was associated with lower intake of total carbohydrates, dairy, and vitamin B-6.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrograms and policies addressing food insecurity in the United States and Mexico may need to take steps to address dietary intake among children in households experiencing food insecurity, possibly through education and programs to increase resources to obtain healthful foods.",

Mothers who have adequate food and good quality nutritional intake generally have better birth outcomes. In cultures where food is scarce, pregnant women may be given extra servings­ of high quality protein items such as eggs or milk or other scarce but nutritious foods when there isn’t sufficient supply for everyone to consume them.

        "abstract": "Food insecurity is a pressing issue in the United States where one in six people suffer from hunger. The older adult population faces unique challenges to receiving adequate nutrition. The federal government currently employs four food and nutrition programs that target the senior population in an effort to address their specific needs. These are the Congregate Meals and Home Delivered Meals Programs (provided through the Older Americans Act), and the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and Child and Adult Care Food Program (provided by the United States Department of Agriculture). As the older adult population continues to grow, it will be important to evaluate and improve these programs and the social policies related to them. This manuscript describes each policy in depth, considers economic and political elements that have shaped each policy, describes the level of program success, and offers suggestions for future research and program development.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity is a pressing issue in the United States where one in six people suffer from hunger. The older adult population faces unique challenges to receiving adequate nutrition. The federal government currently employs four food and nutrition programs that target the senior population in an effort to address their specific needs. These are the Congregate Meals and Home Delivered Meals Programs (provided through the Older Americans Act), and the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and Child and Adult Care Food Program (provided by the United States Department of Agriculture). As the older adult population continues to grow, it will be important to evaluate and improve these programs and the social policies related to them. This manuscript describes each policy in depth, considers economic and political elements that have shaped each policy, describes the level of program success, and offers suggestions for future research and program development.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, various levels of government in the United States have adopted or discussed subsidies, tax breaks, zoning laws, and other public policies that promote geographic access to healthy food. However, there is little evidence from large-scale longitudinal or quasi-experimental research to suggest that the local mix of food outlets actually affects body mass index (BMI). We used a longitudinal design to examine whether the proximity of food outlets, by type, was associated with BMI changes between 2009 and 2014 among 1.7 million veterans in 382 metropolitan areas. We found no evidence that either absolute or relative geographic accessibility of supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, or mass merchandisers was associated with changes in an individual's BMI over time. While policies that alter only geographic access to food outlets may promote equitable access to healthy food and improve nutrition, our findings suggest they will do little to combat obesity in adults.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides participants seasonal Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) vouchers to purchase fruits and vegetables (FV) at farmers’ markets and monthly cash value vouchers (CVV) redeemable at farmers’ markets. Despite the promise of FMNP vouchers and CVV for improving FV access among WIC participants, voucher redemption rates are low. This study evaluated WIC Fresh Start (WFS), a theory-driven, web-based lesson to promote FV intake, the redemption of CVV at farmers’ markets, FMNP voucher redemption, and farmers’ market-related knowledge, attitudes, and skills among women enrolled in WIC.MethodsThe lesson was evaluated in a four-arm randomized controlled trial. The setting was a large New Jersey-based WIC agency located in a densely populated, urban area. Participants (N = 744) were stratified based on FMNP voucher receipt and randomized to receive the WFS lesson or WIC online existing health education. Lesson effects on targeted outcomes were examined at posttest (2 weeks after the lesson) and 3 and 6 months after posttesting.ResultsReceipt of the WFS lesson was associated with FMNP voucher redemption (in the subset of participants preferring to speak Spanish); improvements in knowledge of the FMNP, locally grown seasonal items, seasonal items found at farmers’ markets in July, WIC-authorized farmers’ markets and food- and farmers’ market-specific knowledge; ever having purchased and intentions to purchase FV at a farmers’ market; FV food safety and preparation skills; and modest gains in the redemption of CVV at farmers’ markets. FV intake did not differ over time by trial arm.ConclusionsFindings aid understanding of effective approaches to promote farmers’ market use and farmers’ market-related knowledge and skills among WIC participants. Further research is needed to explore factors that may explain the lack of lesson effects on FV intake.Trial registrationNCT02565706",

        "abstract": "Corporate strategies that target children are controversial given the link between food marketing and childhood obesity. This case study explored diverse stakeholders' accountability expectations and actions for industry policies and practices that used popular cartoon brand mascots and media characters to promote food products to American children. We reviewed five electronic databases and Internet sources between January 2000 and January 2015. Evidence (n = 90) was selected based upon the Institute of Medicine's LEAD principles (i.e. locate, evaluate, assemble evidence to inform decisions) and organized into two tables: peer-reviewed articles, books and grey-literature reports (n = 34); and media stories, news releases and public testimony (n = 56). A four-step accountability framework was used to evaluate accountability structures. The results showed that moderate progress was achieved by stakeholders to take and share the account, limited progress to hold industry and government to account, and limited progress to strengthen accountability structures. Between 2006 and 2015, the U.S. Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative lacked clear policies for companies to use brand mascots and media characters on food packages, in merchandising, and as toy giveaways and premiums. Government, industry and civil society can substantially strengthen their accountability for these food marketing practices to ensure healthy food environments for children.",

        "abstract": "High rates of obesity among low-income populations have led some to question whether USDA's food assistance programs have contributed to this health problem. Using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), this study shows that the association between food assistance program participation and body weight measures has weakened over the past three decades. Earlier NHANES data show that program participants were more likely to be overweight than individuals who were eligible but not participating in the program. This was particularly true among white women. However, the more recent data show that these differences have vanished, as the BMI of the rest of the population has caught up to BMI levels of food stamps recipients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nResearch suggests that schools can play a key role in obesity prevention by implementing evidence-based strategies promoting student health. This study explores school climate factors underlying implementation of evidence-based health and wellness policies and practices in Kindergarten-8th grade programs in the Southwestern United States.\n\n\nMETHOD\nUtilizing a participatory research survey approach conducted in December 2011 with school health professionals (N = 62) and a multiple regression design, a moderated predictive model of implementation climate (i.e., attitudes and beliefs about prevention, school commitment to prevention, barriers, and stakeholder collaboration) was tested.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBarriers to obesity prevention efforts, such as lack of resources, support, or strategy clarity, hinder implementation of healthy food policies despite strong school commitment to prevention. Along with the commitment to prevention, stakeholder collaboration predicts physical education strategies, specifically reducing restricted access to physical education as a punishment for student misconduct.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nObesity prevention strategy implementation relies on the supportiveness and structure of school climates. Barriers to prevention can impede efforts despite school commitment toward prevention, while stakeholder collaboration can enhance the likelihood that practices are in place.",

Using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, we control for selection bias into WIC using the variation in food prices as an instrumental variable. The results of this study are robust to a number of specification and falsification tests. We find WIC decreases exclusive breastfeeding by nearly 50% and increases work leave duration by over 20%.

        "abstract": "Many states including California allow fruit and vegetable checks (FVCs) issued by the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program to be redeemed at farmers’ markets. Despite the potential of the FVC program to increase the revenue of participating farmers and to provide fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables to WIC participants, analysis of data for California shows that redemptions of FVCs at farmers’ markets have to date been miniscule. We study the barriers to use of FVCs at farmers’ markets and consider strategies for expanding both farmer and WIC client participation in the farmers’ market program. Our methodology involved design, implementation and analysis of surveys of both farmers’ market managers and farmer vendors who participate in the program and analysis of the behavior of WIC participants through California WIC program redemption data. One major factor limiting redemptions in California is that relatively few farmers’ markets currently accept FVCs and both market managers and farmers report that the authorization process is onerous. WIC participants who shopped at authorized markets more fully utilized the fixed-dollar value of their voucher, compared with participants who shopped at other authorized WIC vendors. Nevertheless, participants who visited a farmers’ market are unlikely to return. The study concludes with suggested pathways to increase WIC participant utilization of farmers’ markets.",

This research expands the existing literature using an alternative identification strategy and a broader set of outcomes. Using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, we control for selection bias into WIC using the variation in food prices as an instrumental variable. The results of this study are robust to a number of specification and falsification tests. We find WIC decreases exclusive breastfeeding by nearly 50% and increases work leave duration by over 20%.

        "abstract": "Many states including California allow fruit and vegetable checks (FVCs) issued by the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program to be redeemed at farmers’ markets. Despite the potential of the FVC program to increase the revenue of participating farmers and to provide fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables to WIC participants, analysis of data for California shows that redemptions of FVCs at farmers’ markets have to date been miniscule. We study the barriers to use of FVCs at farmers’ markets and consider strategies for expanding both farmer and WIC client participation in the farmers’ market program. Our methodology involved design, implementation and analysis of surveys of both farmers’ market managers and farmer vendors who participate in the program and analysis of the behavior of WIC participants through California WIC program redemption data. One major factor limiting redemptions in California is that relatively few farmers’ markets currently accept FVCs and both market managers and farmers report that the authorization process is onerous. WIC participants who shopped at authorized markets more fully utilized the fixed-dollar value of their voucher, compared with participants who shopped at other authorized WIC vendors. Nevertheless, participants who visited a farmers’ market are unlikely to return. The study concludes with suggested pathways to increase WIC participant utilization of farmers’ markets.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundIncreasing access to healthy foods and beverages in disadvantaged communities is a public health priority due to alarmingly high rates of obesity. The Virtual Supermarket Program (VSP) is a Baltimore City Health Department program that uses online grocery ordering to deliver food to low-income neighborhoods. This study evaluates stakeholder preferences and barriers of program implementation.MethodsThis study assessed the feasibility, sustainability and efficacy of the VSP by surveying 93 customers and interviewing 14 programmatic stakeholders who had recently used the VSP or been involved with program design and implementation.ResultsWe identified the following themes: The VSP addressed transportation barriers and food availability. The VSP impacted customers and the city by including improving food purchasing behavior, creating a food justice “brand for the city”, and fostering a sense of community. Customers appreciated using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to pay for groceries, but policy changes are needed allow online processing of SNAP benefits.ConclusionsThis evaluation summarizes lessons learned and serves as a guide to other public health leaders interested in developing similar programs. Provisions in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm Bill 2014 allow for select grocers to pilot online transactions with SNAP benefits. If these pilots are efficacious, the VSP model could be easily disseminated.",

The Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children (SEBTC) demonstration tested impacts on child nutrition of food benefits of $60 or $30 per eligible child per summer month. A $60 benefit increased children’s mean fruit/vegetable consumption by 0.4 cup-equivalents, whole grains by 0.5 ounce-equivalents, and dairy items by 0.2 cup-equivalents. The $60 benefit had twice the impacts of the $30 benefit, and the SEBTC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) model had the largest improvements in dietary quality at both benefit levels.",

School health programs can help children and adolescents attain full educational potential and good health by providing them with the skills, social support, and environmental reinforcement they need to adopt long-term, healthy eating behaviors. This report summarizes strategies most likely to be effective in promoting healthy eating among school-age youths and provides nutrition education guidelines for a comprehensive school health program. These guidelines are based on a review of research, theory, and current practice, and they were developed by CDC in collaboration with experts from universities and from national, federal, and voluntary agencies. The guidelines include recommendations on seven aspects of a school-based program to promote healthy eating: school policy on nutrition, a sequential, coordinated curriculum, appropriate instruction for students, integration of school food service and nutrition education, staff training, family and community involvement, and program evaluation.",

        "abstract": "The goal of federal food and nutrition programs in the United States is to improve the nutritional well-being and health of low income families. A large body of literature evaluates the extent to which the Supplemental Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) has accomplished this goal, but most studies have been based on research designs that compare program participants to non-participants. If selection into these programs is non-random then such comparisons will lead to biased estimates of the program's true effects. In this study we use the rollout of the WIC program across counties to estimate the impact of the program on infant health. We find that the implementation of WIC led to an increase in average birth weight and a decrease in the fraction of births that are classified as low birth weight. We find no evidence that these estimates are driven by changes in fertility or selection into live births. Our preferred estimates suggest that WIC initiation raised average birth weight by 2g, or by 7g among infants born to mothers with low education levels. These translate into estimated birth weight increases among participating mothers of approximately 18 to 29g. Estimated treatments on the treated impacts among infants born to participating mothers with low education are of similar magnitude.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents results of a study that was conducted for the purposes of describing available human services resources relating to nutrition, physical health, and behavioral health for new and recent immigrants (predominantly Mexican immigrants, but groups from Southeast Asia and continental Africa as well) in Guilford County, NC. Sixty-five service providers were determined to represent cultural adaptation resources providing either direct and/or ancillary assistance to limited English proficient immigrants. Seventeen direct assistance providers specialized in food and nutrition programs, but only 2 had targeted programs for addressing food scarcity, insecurity, and nutritional deficiencies in immigrant households. Four of 15 direct physical health services providers had clinical care or specialty programs for immigrants. Finally, 5 of 16 direct behavioral health care providers offered mental health treatment and counseling services adapted specifically for targeted immigrant groups. These findings highlight the limited development of the existing human services network to increase its capacity to provide nutrition and health related services to a growing community of diverse immigrant groups. These descriptive results underscore a need for additional local level or community based resources to be directed towards increasing the community’s ability to provide essential human services to population groups not yet language proficient and acculturated to “American community standards.”",

VAR model predicted over $120,000 less per month in forecast errors in comparison to the ARIMA model.",

Analysts must forward the best objective statistical analysis and data inputs to formula specifications while acknowledging the politics of the legislative process that authorizes federal funding formulas. This article evaluates the federal funding formula for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) using key formula components of need, effort, capacity, and performance. We also examine the operationalization and measure of the target population in the SCHIP funding formula. Legislative decisions on formulas are, by nature, based on compromises that balance competing policy objectives. The analyst's role is to continually review current research standards, data quality, and relevant formula inputs and make recommendations to refine federal funding formulas to better target resources to their intended populations.",

        "abstract": "Although the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has been credited with increasing birth weights and improving child health, the program has been criticized for reducing breastfeeding through the provision of free formula. Yet WIC recipients are socio-economically disadvantaged as compared to non-participants. As a result, whether lower breastfeeding rates reflect the effect of the program or the types of women who participate is unknown. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics -- Child Development Supplement, this study uses propensity scores and fixed-effects estimation to determine the effect of WIC on breastfeeding initiation and duration. Our study is the first to use a method other than Ordinary Least Squares to analyze the association between WIC and breastfeeding behaviors. Results indicate that the negative association is likely spurious, arising from the poor socio-demographic profile of participants.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Despite the benefits associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), over 1 in 4 eligible infants and 6 in 10 eligible children do not receive WIC. The reasons for these high rates of non-participation are analyzed in this paper through a comparison of the short- and long-run economic health of (a) WIC recipients, (b) persons who have left WIC, and (c) persons who have never entered the program despite being eligible for benefits. Using data from the 1996 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, I find that in both the short- and long-run, infants and children who have left WIC are better-off than those staying on WIC and infants and children who never receive WIC are better off than both those on WIC and those who have left WIC. However, in absolute terms, a large number of non-recipients remain eligible and seemingly in need of WIC. This is especially true for infants who have left WIC—on average, in any month, over 35% have incomes below the poverty line; almost 20% have incomes below 50% of the poverty line; almost a third receive food stamps; and over 80% remain eligible for WIC.",

        "abstract": "Recently, we have seen various proposed laws that would require that women considering abortions be given ultrasounds along with explanations of these ultrasounds. Proponents of these laws could argue that they are assisting with autonomous abortion choices by providing needed information, especially about the ontological status of the fetus. Arguing against these proposed laws, I first claim that their supporters fail to appreciate how personalized an abortion choice must be. Second, I argue that these laws would provide the pregnant woman no control over when and to what extent emotion is inserted into her deliberation. This unjustly inhibits her autonomy, making these ultrasound laws unjustified.",

        "abstract": "The Network for a Healthy California (Network) is a statewide social marketing initiative led by the California Department of Public Health, funded in part by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide nutrition education to people who are certified as likely or potentially eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Network targets persons whose household income falls below 185% of the federal poverty level (FPL). An essential tool for the Network for identifying geographic areas of the state where large proportions of the target audience can be reached with program activities is a geographic information systems (GIS) application. Geographic information systems is a powerful tool for interpreting data and planning program delivery because of its unique abilities to bring together the functions of computerized databases and the output of geographic-based, visual information into the form of maps. Geographic information systems is an example of information technology being used in public health to help foster collaboration among disciplines and social programs to find common integration points that potentially allow for merging diverse information streams. Geographic information systems is",

An online training was systematically developed using Smith and Ragan's instructional design model, the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, principles of adult learning, and selected constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory. Changes in knowledge, identification of inappropriate teaching practices, and self-efficacy, were assessed. Within- and between-group comparisons were done using ANCOVA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe intervention group scored significantly higher (P < .05) in all evaluations compared with preassessments and the comparison group. After delayed intervention, the comparison group scored significantly higher (P < .05) than in preassessments. Paraprofessionals reacted positively to future online trainings and were interested in them.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nA video-based online training is an effective method to complement in-person trainings to prepare paraprofessionals to teach nutrition lessons.",

Effectiveness and cost of Facebook to recruit low-income women to an online nutrition program were examined, including biopsychosocial characteristics of Facebook responders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn ad appeared on the Facebook page of low-income women, 18-45 years old, living in Pennsylvania to invite access to an online nutrition program. Eligible persons completed surveys about food-related behaviors including eating competence, food security, and assistance program use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 465 people who clicked on the ad, 81 completed the eligibility survey, and 62 were eligible; 52 completed a preprogram survey. Completers were mostly white (79%), overweight/obese (mean body mass index 36.2 ± 12.9), and not eating competent (75%). Low-income status was identified for 75% (n = 39) of completers. Total recruitment cost over 19 days was $596.71.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nFacebook appears to be an effective tool to recruit low-income women to nutrition education projects.",

        "abstract": "Low-income families face an enormous burden to achieve economic security since the deterioration of a guaranteed safety net. Health insurance coverage is uneven, affordable childcare falls short of demand, and wage earnings insufficiently support family needs. This analysis focuses on recent trends in family formation, the impact of policy changes on families of color and of immigrant status, and explores the daily challenges and coping strategies low-income families use to survive despite insufficient resources. Four key findings emerge from this body of knowledge: (1) Low-income families experience severe hardships when relying on cash assistance, work, or a combination of both; (2) Low-income families are resilient and resourceful; (3) Low-income families face significant barriers to using public and private services along with increasing earnings from work; and (4) The quality of life for families of color and immigrant families is directly affected by employment and service sector practices. Future research needs to focus on identifying the critical unmet needs of low-income families.",

An online training was systematically developed using Smith and Ragan's instructional design model, the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, principles of adult learning, and selected constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory. Changes in knowledge, identification of inappropriate teaching practices, and self-efficacy, were assessed. Within- and between-group comparisons were done using ANCOVA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe intervention group scored significantly higher (P < .05) in all evaluations compared with preassessments and the comparison group. After delayed intervention, the comparison group scored significantly higher (P < .05) than in preassessments. Paraprofessionals reacted positively to future online trainings and were interested in them.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nA video-based online training is an effective method to complement in-person trainings to prepare paraprofessionals to teach nutrition lessons.",

        "abstract": "\"Despite the benefits of prenatal participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), many eligible women either do not participate or begin participation late in their pregnancies. Using recent nationally representative data, we find that more disadvantaged women are more likely to access WIC and, with some notable exceptions, to participate earlier in their pregnancies. Hispanic women, especially those with language difficulties, enroll in WIC later in their pregnancies. Early WIC participation, particularly among teenagers, is less likely among women experiencing a first birth and depends on the mother's early recognition of her pregnancy. \"(\"JEL \"I18, I30) Copyright (c) 2008 Western Economic Association International.",

        "abstract": "\"Despite the benefits of prenatal participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), many eligible women either do not participate or begin participation late in their pregnancies. Using recent nationally representative data, we find that more disadvantaged women are more likely to access WIC and, with some notable exceptions, to participate earlier in their pregnancies. Hispanic women, especially those with language difficulties, enroll in WIC later in their pregnancies. Early WIC participation, particularly among teenagers, is less likely among women experiencing a first birth and depends on the mother's early recognition of her pregnancy. \"(\"JEL \"I18, I30) Copyright (c) 2008 Western Economic Association International.",

Data were collected by survey using a convenience sample of 200 low-income elderly people living in subsidized housing. Although there were no significant differences in food group or nutrient intake between participants and nonparticipants, overall, these low-income subjects did not meet minimum Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) standards for many nutrients and had caloric and food group serving intakes that were below recommendations. Food Stamp Program participants were at significantly higher nutrition risk than their nonparticipating peers as detected by the Nutrition Screening Initiative Checklist (P< or =.01) and other indicators of disability. It seems that those already at highest risk were in fact participating in the Food Stamp Program because those eligible but not participating had significantly higher incomes and were at significantly lower nutritional risk.",

Methods: Participants and nonparticipants in a food box program were surveyed to determine differences between the two groups and change over time. Results: Fruit and vegetable intake declined in those who left the program after several months, and intake of fruit, carrots, and vegetables was lower among those who had left than among those who remained in the program. Food insecurity was associated with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables. Conclusions: Participation in a food box program can provide some benefit in terms of increased fruit and vegetable consumption for those who use the program regularly. Increasing the frequency of the box and encouraging continued use may improve these effects.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFood insecurity and obesity have potential health consequences for migrant and seasonal farm workers (MSFW).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-six Latino MSFW working in eastern North Carolina whose children attended Migrant Head Start completed interviews, focus groups and home visits. Content analysis, nutrient analysis, and non-parametric statistical analysis produced results.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMSFW (63.8%) families were food insecure; of those, 34.7% experienced hunger. 32% of pre-school children were food insecure. Food secure families spent more money on food. Obesity was prevalent in adults and children but the relationship to food insecurity remains unclear. Strategies to reduce risk of foods insecurity were employed by MSFW, but employer and community assistance is needed to reduce their risk.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFood insecurity is rooted in the cultural lifestyle of farmwork, poverty, and dependency. MSFW obesity and food insecurity require further study to determine the relationship with migration and working conditions. Networking and social support are important for MSFW families to improve food security. Policies and community/workplace interventions could reduce risk of food insecurity and improve the health of workers.",

        "abstract": "To describe income levels and the prevalence of major hardships among women during or just before pregnancy. We separately analyzed 2002–2006 population-based postpartum survey data from California’s Maternal and Infant Health Assessment (n = 18,332) and 19 states participating in CDC’s Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (n = 143,452) to examine income and several hardships (divorce/separation, domestic violence, homelessness, financial difficulties, spouse/partner’s or respondent’s involuntary job loss or incarceration, and, in California only, food insecurity and no social support) during/just before pregnancy. In both samples, over 30% of women were poor (income ≤100% of federal poverty level [FPL]) and 20% near-poor (101–200% FPL); and around 60% of low-income (poor or near-poor) women experienced at least one hardship. While hardship prevalence decreased significantly as income increased, many non-low-income women also experienced hardships; e.g., in California, 43% of all women and 13% with incomes >400% FPL experienced one or more hardships. These findings paint a disturbing picture of experiences around the time of pregnancy in the United States for many women giving birth and their children, particularly because 60% had previous births. The high prevalence of low income and of serious hardships during pregnancy is of concern, given previous research documenting the adverse health consequences of these experiences and recognition of pregnancy as a critical period for health throughout the life course. Low income and major hardships around the time of pregnancy should be addressed as mainstream U.S. maternal-infant health and social policy issues.",

        "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Approximately 2.5% of adults in the United States and 4% of adults in Canada follow vegetarian diets. A vegetarian diet is defined as one that does not include meat, fish, or fowl. Interest in vegetarianism appears to be increasing, with many restaurants and college foodservices offering vegetarian meals routinely. Substantial growth in sales of foods attractive to vegetarians has occurred and these foods appear in many supermarkets. This position paper reviews the current scientific data related to key nutrients for vegetarians including protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, vitamin A, n-3 fatty acids, and iodine. A vegetarian, including vegan, diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients. In some cases, use of fortified foods or supplements can be helpful in meeting recommendations for individual nutrients. Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits including lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, and phytochemicals. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower body mass indices than non-vegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from ischemic heart disease, lower blood cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer. While a number of federally funded and institutional feeding programs can accommodate vegetarians, few have foods suitable for vegans at this time. Because of the variability of dietary practices among vegetarians, individual assessment of dietary intakes of vegetarians is required. Dietetics professionals have a responsibility to support and encourage those who express an interest in consuming a vegetarian diet. They can play key roles in educating vegetarian clients about food sources of specific nutrients, food purchase and preparation, and any dietary modifications that may be necessary to meet individual needs. Menu planning for vegetarians can be simplified by use of a food guide that specifies food groups and serving sizes.",

Data were collected by survey using a convenience sample of 200 low-income elderly people living in subsidized housing. Although there were no significant differences in food group or nutrient intake between participants and nonparticipants, overall, these low-income subjects did not meet minimum Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) standards for many nutrients and had caloric and food group serving intakes that were below recommendations. Food Stamp Program participants were at significantly higher nutrition risk than their nonparticipating peers as detected by the Nutrition Screening Initiative Checklist (P< or =.01) and other indicators of disability. It seems that those already at highest risk were in fact participating in the Food Stamp Program because those eligible but not participating had significantly higher incomes and were at significantly lower nutritional risk.",

Results: Fruit and vegetable intake declined in those who left the program after several months, and intake of fruit, carrots, and vegetables was lower among those who had left than among those who remained in the program. Food insecurity was associated with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables. Conclusions: Participation in a food box program can provide some benefit in terms of increased fruit and vegetable consumption for those who use the program regularly. Increasing the frequency of the box and encouraging continued use may improve these effects.",

        "abstract": "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is a federally-funded food assistance program for low income participants who are at nutritional risk. Beneficiaries receive vouchers for specific foods and brands, selected for their nutritional value. While the program is designed to improve nutrition, it may also induce changes in consumption behavior that persist beyond participation in the program. In this paper, we study how participation in WIC impacts the consumption patterns and preferences during and after the program. Our analysis focuses on the cereal category, in which the subsidized brands must meet certain nutritional guidelines. As expected, during the program households increase cereal consumption volume and shift their choices towards the WIC-approved brands. More interesting is that once households exit the program, the higher category consumption rate and elevated share of WIC brands persist. To understand the behavioral mechanism underlying these consumption patterns, we estimate a choice model and find an increased preference for WIC brands after controlling for state dependence. The evidence suggests that this targeted food subsidy program is effective in creating behavior change that persists even after the incentive is withdrawn.",

        "abstract": "Frequent consumption of simple carbohydrates, primarily in the form of dietary sugars, is significantly associated with increased dental caries risk. Malnutrition (undernutrition or overnutrition) in children is often a consequence of inappropriate infant and childhood feeding practices and dietary behaviors associated with limited access to fresh, nutrient dense foods, substituting instead high-energy, low-cost, nutrient-poor sugary and fatty foods. Lack of availability of quality food stores in rural and poor neighborhoods, food insecurity, and changing dietary beliefs resulting from acculturation, including changes in traditional ethnic eating behaviors, can further deter healthful eating and increase risk for early childhood caries and obesity. America is witnessing substantial increases in children and ethnic minorities living in poverty, widening the gap in oral health disparities noted in Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General. Dental and other care providers can educate and counsel pregnant women, parents, and families to promote healthy eating behaviors and should advocate for governmental policies and programs that decrease parental financial and educational barriers to achieving healthy diets. For families living in poverty, however, greater efforts are needed to facilitate access to affordable healthy foods, particularly in urban and rural neighborhoods, to effect positive changes in children's diets and advance the oral components of general health.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine if (1) participation in Home-Delivered Meals (HDM) results in improved dietary patterns and nutrient intake, lower food insecurity, and reduced loss of weight; (2) subgroups of older persons are more likely to benefit; and (3) nutritional indicators of impact other than nutrient intake may be useful. The design used was quasi-experimental, with longitudinal assessment of individuals on HDM at baseline (before receipt of services), 6, and 12 months, and comparison to non-randomized group receiving other services. Outcomes included measured weight and height, 24-hour dietary recall, and food insecurity. Paired t test, multiple linear regression, and selection models using multiple logistic regression were performed. All older persons in three New York State counties referred for aging services over a 5-month period were asked to participate (n = 456), and 212 agreed (171 on HDM). At 6 months, the sample size was 101 (34 discharged, 42 hospital/died/moved, 26 chose not to continue), and at 12 months it was 68 (similar reasons). After receiving meals for 6 and 12 months, participants showed greater improvement in most dietary intake variables than either a non-HDM comparison group or HDM participants who ate no HDM meal on the day of assessment. Compared to initial values, participants improved significantly in some variables for dietary patterns, nutrient intake, and nutrient density, and were less likely to be food insecure. Furthermore, HDM was more likely to impact those living alone and those with poorer initial status. This study provides strong evidence that HDM has a positive impact on the nutritional well-being of older persons. Food insecurity and dietary patterns are useful nutritional indicators of impact.",

Frequency counts and percentages were obtained while independent t-tests and Chi-square were carried out to compare WIC FMNP participants to non-WIC participants (p ≤ 0.05). The age range of most (62%) of the visitors was 25–54 and the majority were female (91%). The primary motivators for market attendance included variety of F&V (76%), quality of F&V (55%), and to purchase food grown locall...",

A system of nutrient equations with dual endogenous programs is estimated by the maximum-likelihood procedure. WIC is found to increase the intakes of three of the four important nutrients for WIC children, including iron, potassium, and fiber. SNAP only has a small and negative effect on fiber intake. The additional benefit of SNAP participation is non-existent given participation in WIC.",

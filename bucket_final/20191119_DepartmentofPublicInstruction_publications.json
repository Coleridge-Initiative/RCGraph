        "abstract": "In 1876, an American by the name of Benjamin Smith Lyman submitted to the Japanese government a geological map of ‘Yesso’, which had been compiled under his direction. This map displayed the assumed stratigraphy of Hokkaido, in northern Japan, and is considered the first modern geological map to be produced by an Asian state. This provided a new means of comprehending territory, at exactly the moment the land in question was being re-presented as Hokkaido. The strata exhumed in the course of mapping this land at depth were not limited to those under the Earth. The map was assembled atop a history of Japanese control over the region, one which accounted for the precocious presence of an earlier American survey, conducted under the previous Tokugawa government, which had sought to map mineral deposits in this land of Yesso. These in turn reflected a longer history of mineral extraction, present in the earliest accounts of Ezo, and the motivation for Japan to have long ‘held the reins’ over this amorphous region. The 1876 geological map is a striking example of colonial modernity, through which we are able to observe the institutional mimicry characteristic to, and increasingly emphasized in the study of, late-nineteenth century inter-imperial society. The presence of this map challenges us to recover the various strata atop of which this imperial sociability was able to flourish, and examine the role of the map in incorporating a modernizing Japan within a globally-comprehensible means of territorial authority and control.",

        "abstract": "Decision-making to satisfy the basic human needs of health, food, and education is complex, accomplishing this in such a way that solutions are personalized to the needs of the individual has been the focus of my research. This chapter will present an overview of my research with several of my former students in the area of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty with a focus on human-centric decision problems in three primary areas: health care, humanitarian logistics, and education. This research seeks to inform decision-making with the goal of improving decision quality. To this end, this research utilizes and develops theory in the areas of Markov decision processes (MDPs), semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs), partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), optimization, simulation, and Bayesian decision analysis to address these real-world problems. This research has made an impact on how researchers and practitioners address complex societal issues, such as health disparities, public health preparedness, hunger relief, student performance, and personalized medical decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge gaps, false beliefs, and limited skills with regard to child maltreatment are commonly found among teachers, despite their vital role in the lives of maltreated children. In Canada, little has been done to develop training or other supports for teachers around detecting and responding to child maltreatment. This study conducted a multi-informant assessment of teachers’ child maltreatment training needs, as well as identified factors that may influence teachers’ training participation and use of maltreatment-related knowledge and skills. We gathered qualitative information from three informant groups in one Canadian city, namely 19 school social workers, 9 child welfare practitioners, and 21 foster caregivers. Participants shared their experiences when working with teachers to support maltreated children, as well as their beliefs about gaps in teachers’ maltreatment-related knowledge and skills. Participants were also asked about factors that might influence the delivery of child maltreatment training to teachers and teachers’ responses to maltreatment-related behaviour at school. Findings showed consensus across all three participant groups that child maltreatment training for teachers is currently inadequate. Participants identified gaps in knowledge and skills among teachers in the detection and reporting of suspected maltreatment, as well as in their use of trauma-sensitive classroom strategies. Findings also highlighted multi-level factors that may affect teachers’ decision-making and actions in response to child maltreatment, especially school- (e.g. inadequate educational resources) and teacher-level influences (e.g. teacher overburden). Recommendations for teacher training, implications for school staff and other professionals, and future directions for research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Importance\nPostnatal home visitation to support parenting and infant healthy development is becoming increasingly common based on university efficacy studies, but effectiveness when disseminated by communities is not clear.\n\n\nObjective\nTo test implementation and impact of the Family Connects (FC) program when administered by a community agency.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nIn this randomized clinical trial, births were randomly assigned to receive FC or treatment as usual. Independent evaluation was conducted through parent interviews and review of health and child protective services records. Interviewers were blind to the experimental condition of participants, and participants were blind about the purpose of the interview as an intervention evaluation. A total of 936 consecutive residential births at Duke University Hospital from January 1, 2014, through June 30, 2014, were included. Data were analyzed preliminarily for reporting to funders in early 2015 before all birth-record covariates were scored and were analyzed more comprehensively in mid-2019 after administrative birth and child protective service records became available.\n\n\nInterventions\nThe goals of the FC brief universal program were to assess family-specific needs, complete brief interventions, and connect families with community resources. Community agencies and families were aligned through an electronic data system.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nCase records documented program penetration and quality. The primary outcome was child protective services investigations for maltreatment. Secondary outcomes were the number of sustained community connections, maternal mental health, parenting behavior, infant well-child care visits and maternal postpartum care compliance, and emergency health care utilization.\n\n\nResults\nOf 936 births, 451 infants (48.2%) were female and 433 (46.3%) were from racial/ethnic minority groups. In all, 456 births (46.5%) were randomized to the intervention and 480 (53.5%) were randomized to the control. All analyses were based on intention to treat. The impact analysis included 158 intervention families and 158 control families. Intervention penetration was 76%, adherence to the protocol was 90%, and independent agreement in scoring (κ) was 0.75. Nurses identified and addressed minor problems for 52% of families and connected an additional 42% to community resources. Analysis of the primary outcome of child abuse investigations revealed a mean (SD) of 0.10 (0.30) investigations for the intervention group vs 0.18 (0.56) investigations for the control group (b = -0.09; 90% CI, -0.01 to -0.12; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.01; P = .07). The intervention group's rate of possible maternal anxiety or depression was 18.2% vs 25.9% for the control group (b = -7.70; 90% CI, -15.2 to -0.1; 95% CI, -16.6 to 1.3; P = .09).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study indicates that a nurse home visitation program for families of newborns can be implemented by a community agency with high penetration and quality. Other communities could benefit from wider dissemination of the program provided that quality remains strong and evaluation continues.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01843036.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nShorter gestational age at birth is associated with worse academic performance in childhood. Socio-economic and demographic factors that affect a child's development may modify the relationship between gestational age and later academic performance.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate socio-economic and demographic effect modification of gestational age's association with kindergarten-level literacy skills in a longitudinal Wisconsin birth cohort.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe sampled 153 145 singleton births (2007-2010) that linked to Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening-Kindergarten (PALS-K) scores (2012-2016 school years). PALS-K outcomes included meeting the screening benchmark (≥28 points, range 0-102 points) and the standardised score. Multivariable linear regressions of PALS-K outcomes on gestational age (completed weeks) included individual interactions for five maternal attributes measured at delivery: Medicaid coverage, education, age, race/ethnicity, and marital status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEach additional completed gestational week was associated with a 0.5 percentage point increase in the probability of meeting the PALS-K literacy benchmark. The benefit of an additional week of gestational age was 0.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval 0.3, 0.7 percentage points) greater for Medicaid-covered births (0.8 percentage points) relative to non-Medicaid births (0.3 percentage points). Relative to only completing high school, having college education weakened this association by 0.3-0.6 percentage points, depending on years in college. Similar but modest relations emerged with standardised scores.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSocio-economic advantage as indicated by non-Medicaid coverage or higher levels of completed maternal education may diminish the cost of preterm birth on a child's kindergarten-level literacy skills.",

        "abstract": "The autism intervention literature focuses heavily on the concept of evidence-based practice, with less consideration of the acceptability, feasibility, and contextual alignment of interventions in practice. A survey of 130 special educators was conducted to quantify this \"social validity\" of evidence-based practices and analyze its relationship with knowledge level and frequency of use. Results indicate that knowledge, use, and social validity are tightly-connected and rank the highest for modeling, reinforcement, prompting, and visual supports. Regression analysis suggests that greater knowledge, higher perceived social validity, and a caseload including more students with autism predicts more frequent use of a practice. The results support the vital role that social validity plays in teachers' implementation, with implications for both research and practice.",

        "abstract": "As instructional reforms are shifting focus from reading and math achievement towards social–emotional learning and challenging coursework that prepares students for college, careers, and citizenship, this study addresses how leaders in two school districts actively served as mid-level implementers of global education, an instructional reform that extends teaching and learning beyond traditionally tested subject areas. This qualitative comparative case study of global education implementation in two school districts found that leaders in both districts strategically supported global education implementation by generating will, building capacity, and re-orienting the organization, but differed in specific strategies they deployed based upon preferences for top-down or top-and-bottom approaches to systems change. Common strategies found in both cases point to specific ways that district leaders can exert agency in supporting teaching and learning that prepares students with the twenty-first century skills needed to thrive in a pluralistic, interconnected world, and raises new questions about which district-level implementation approaches are most effective in enacting change in schools and classrooms.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is consensus that early childhood lead exposure causes adverse cognitive and behavioral effects, even at blood lead levels (BLL) below 5 μg/dL. What has not been established is to what extent the effects of childhood lead exposure persist across grades.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo measure the effects of early childhood lead exposure (BLL 1-10 μg/dL) on educational performance from grades 3-8; to determine if effects in lower grades persist as a child progresses through school; and if so, to characterize the pattern of persistence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe examine data from 560,624 children living in North Carolina between 2000 and 2012 with a BLL ≤10 μg/dL measured between age 0-5 years. Children are matched to their standardized math and reading scores for grades 3-8, creating an unbalanced panel of 2,344,358 student-year observations. We use socio-economic, demographic, and school information along with matching techniques to control for confounding effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe find that early childhood exposure to low lead levels caused persistent deficits in educational performance across grades. In each grade (3-8), children with higher blood lead levels had, on average, lower percentile scores in both math and reading than children with lower blood lead levels. In our primary model, we find that children with BLL = 5 μg/dL in early childhood ranked 0.90-1.20 (1.35-1.55) percentiles lower than children with BLL ≤ 1 μg/dL on math (reading) tests during grades 3-8. As children progressed through school, the average percentile deficit in their test scores remained stable.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study shows that the adverse effects of early childhood exposure to low lead levels persist through early adolescence, and that the magnitude of the test-score percentile deficit remains steady between grades 3-8.",

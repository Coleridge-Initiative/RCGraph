        "abstract": "This report is a primer on the use of debt by U.S. farm businesses for policymakers, researchers, and others interested in the financial well-being of U.S. agriculture. It presents data on basic debt-use patterns by farm businesses (in 2011, over 900,000 farms operated as farm businesses based on their size, organizational structure, or the occupation of their principal operator) and explores key trends over 20 years. U.S. farm debt use varies widely by farm size, specialization, operator age, and other farm characteristics. Largescale farm businesses, farm businesses with younger operators, and dairy and poultry farm businesses all have higher levels of debt use. Both average debt-to-asset ratios and the share of farm businesses with high debt-to-asset ratios have declined over time.",

        "abstract": "Decoupled payments were thought to have minimal impacts on current production decisions and input use. However, the literature has identified several mechanisms through which decoupled payments become coupled. We analyze the effects of uncertainty regarding future policy changes on farm-level production decisions and input use, focusing on farmers’ expectations of base acreage and yield updating. Using farm-level data, we find positive relationships between both decoupled and other government payments and real per acre expenditures on agricultural chemicals. Furthermore, there is evidence that decoupled payments may affect the intensive margin more than other government payments.",

        "abstract": "The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program is a counter-cyclical income support program that was designed to provide price support to dairy farmers. Since inception of MILC, it has been argued that the program is inefficient and rewards inefficiency by keeping high-cost, small dairy farms in business. Using farm-level data and the probit estimation method, we investigated the factors that affect a farmer's decision to participate in the MILC program. Participation in the MILC program was positively correlated with the farmer's educational attainment, participation in the organic certification cost share subsidy program, off-farm work by spouses, and financial recordkeeping. Consistent with theory, participation in the MILC program is negatively correlated with the price of milk. Finally, contrary to the established narrative of large dairy producers, medium-sized dairy farms are more likely than large farms to participate in the MILC program.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the factors likely to affect an individual’s decision to enter farming after and/or while participating in an off-farm employment activity. Additionally, an ordered multivariate regression procedure was used to analyze the degree of importance of selected motivating reasons that were drivers of individuals’ decision to enter farming. Results indicate that individuals with lower education, children in the household, and older family members were more likely to have entered farming as an occupation. Findings further suggest that federal policies in the form of farm program payments may provide retired nonfarm workers incentives to enter farming in later life.",

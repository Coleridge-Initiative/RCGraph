        "abstract": "Recurrent, tidally driven coastal flooding is one of the most visible signs of sea level rise. Recent studies have shown that such flooding will become more frequent and extensive as sea level continues to rise, potentially altering the landscape and livability of coastal communities decades before sea level rise causes coastal land to be permanently inundated. In this study, we identify US communities that will face effective inundation—defined as having 10% or more of livable land area flooded at least 26 times per year—with three localized sea level rise scenarios based on projections for the 3 rd US National Climate Assessment. We present these results in a new, online interactive tool that allows users to explore when and how effective inundation will impact their communities. In addition, we identify communities facing effective inundation within the next 30 years that contain areas of high socioeconomic vulnerability today using a previously published vulnerability index. With the Intermediate-High and Highest sea level rise scenarios, 489 and 668 communities, respectively, would face effective inundation by the year 2100. With these two scenarios, more than half of communities facing effective inundation by 2045 contain areas of current high socioeconomic vulnerability. These results highlight the timeframes that US coastal communities have to respond to disruptive future inundation. The results also underscore the importance of limiting future warming and sea level rise: under the Intermediate-Low scenario, used as a proxy for sea level rise under the Paris Climate Agreement, 199 fewer communities would be effectively inundated by 2100.",

        "abstract": "Most estimates of global mean sea-level rise this century fall below 2 m. This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASA’s SRTM. CoastalDEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show – employing CoastalDEM—that 190 M people (150–250 M, 90% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 230 M below 1 m. Accurate estimates of global mean sea-level rise are important. Here the authors employ a new digital elevation model (DEM) utilizing neural networks and show that the new DEM more than triples the NASA SRTM-based estimates of current global population occupying land below projected sea levels in 2100, with more than 200 million people could be affected based on RCP4.5 and 2 degC of warming.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Positive vertical bias in elevation data derived from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is known to cause substantial underestimation of coastal flood risks and exposure. Previous attempts to correct SRTM elevations have used regression to predict vertical error from a small number of auxiliary data products, but these efforts have been focused on reducing error introduced solely by vegetative land cover. Here, we employ a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network to perform a 23-dimensional vertical error regression analyses, where in addition to vegetation cover indices, we use variables including neighborhood elevation values, population density, land slope, and local SRTM deviations from ICESat altitude observations. Using lidar data as ground truth, we train the neural network on samples of US data from 1–20 m of elevation according to SRTM, and assess outputs with extensive testing sets in the US and Australia. Our adjustment system reduces mean vertical bias in the coastal US from 3.67 m to less than 0.01 m, and in Australia from 2.49 m to 0.11 m. RMSE is cut by roughly one-half at both locations, from 5.36 m to 2.39 m in the US, and from 4.15 m to 2.46 in Australia. Using ICESat data as a reference, we estimate that global bias falls from 1.88 m to −0.29 m, and RMSE from 4.28 m and 3.08 m. The methods presented here are flexible and effective, and can be effectively applied to land cover of all types, including dense urban development. The resulting enhanced global coastal DEM (CoastalDEM) promises to greatly improve the accuracy of sea level rise and coastal flood analyses worldwide.",

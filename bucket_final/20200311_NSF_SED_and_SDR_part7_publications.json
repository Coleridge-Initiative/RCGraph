        "abstract": "This is the first paper that seeks to reconcile the large and persistent differences across data sources in the number of new economics PhDs that U.S. universities produce. During 1997â€“2006, the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) reported 11,524 such degrees in all specialties, compared to 10,812 degrees by the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and 8,862 dissertations listed in the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL). The comparable estimates in general economics (GE) were 9,504, 8,534, and 7,856, respectively. Such differences can lead to problematic assessments of the balance between supply and demand in the market for new PhDs. The study finds that the SED picks up the most new economics PhDs, but it also attracts an unknown number of graduates of business schools and interdisciplinary programs. IPEDS has the most detailed classification framework of specialty degrees, but undercounts graduates of larger GE programs and misclassifies some GE programs. The JEL's annual lists provide useful information on the content of doctoral research, but suffer from serious under-reporting by economics departments. After adjusting counts, the study estimates that about 9,100 GE degrees were conferred during the survey decade. The paper offers a rule of thumb for estimating adjusted counts in future years. An epilog finds that other social science disciplines have problems counting new doctoral dissertations and making lists of them accessible to researchers.",

Data spanning the time period from 1995–2001 indicate that the percentage of bachelor's and master's degrees awarded to members of racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields was lower in the geosciences than in other STEM fields. The percentage of Ph.D. degrees awarded in the geosciences to students drawn from underrepresented groups from 1995–2001 was similar to the percentage awarded in math and computer science, physical science, and engineering. It appears that the geosciences retain a greater number of students drawn from underrepresented groups during the transition from master's to Ph.D. degree programs, and/or recruit underrepresented students into Ph.D. programs from other STEM fields. The geosciences have had success recruiting and retaining w...",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to examine application materials for assistant professor positions in 3 academic disciplines. Applicants were asked to write a diversity statement describing how they would advance diversity through their research, teaching, and service. The sample included application materials submitted by 191 candidates for tenure-track faculty positions at a public research university in computer science, political science, and psychology. Application letters and diversity statements were coded for 9 diversity dimensions. For example, My research in the Latino community . . ., and I volunteer at a middle school to encourage more girls to pursue computer science . . ., would be coded as reflecting the diversity dimensions of ethnicity/race and gender, respectively. Applicant self-disclosures of diversity were uncommon, occurring in fewer than 1 quarter of the letters. Nonspecific forms of diversity were most frequently mentioned in application materials, followed by references to ethnicity/race, disability, age, and gender. Comparisons between the searches revealed that psychologist applicants had significantly higher density of references to diversity in their letters than the 2 other disciplines, and also were most likely to cite specific, rather than nonspecific, dimensions of diversity. These results add to our understanding of how faculty applicants approach the diversity statement component of applications and reveal potential differences between disciplines in the diversity construct. The results are discussed in terms of suggestions to faculty applicants and directions for further research.",

        "abstract": "Recent growth in international enrollment at U.S. universities has raised controversy. While critics accuse international students of displacing American students, university administrators have argued that they provide much needed tuition revenue. This paper examines how international students impact domestic enrollment, focusing on a unique boom and bust in international matriculation into U.S. graduate programs from 1995 to 2005. Overall foreign students appear to increase domestic enrollment. This positive effect is linked to cross-subsidization, whereby high net tuition payments from foreign students help subsidize the cost of enrolling additional domestic students.",

Overall, arguments pro and against the view that international graduate students displace US students in the pursuit of higher degrees in science and engineering have been based on opinion or retrospective analysis. While these studies offer useful insights, ultimately they fall short of supporting decision making in educational policymaking because they do not provide a prospective analysis. The goal of this paper is to address this gap through the development of forecasting models of foreign and domestic student enrolment in advanced degree programmes. The results of our study suggest that current foreign student enrolment rates may be optimal and educational policies aimed at strengthening the participation of US students in graduate programmes science and engineering needs to consider measures other than reducing international students’ enrolment rates.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we discuss the recent evolutions of science and engineering doctoral and postdoctoral education in Europe. Indeed, Ph.Ds are crucial to the conduct of research and innovation in the national innovation systems, as they provide a large amount of input into creating the competitive advantage, notably through basic research. First, we show that Asia, and notably China, is producing more Ph.Ds than the United States and Europe. In many EU countries, the number of Ph.Ds has levelled off or even declined recently in many natural sciences and engineering fields. Second, we discuss the European situation in the international competition for talents. We study the European brain drain question, mainly at the doctoral and postdoctoral level. We find that there is an asymmetry in the flows of Ph.D students and postdoctorates between Europe and the United States, at the advantage of this latter country. These two points — production of Ph.Ds, international flows of doctorates and postdoctorates — lead us to be concerned about the future growth and innovation in Europe. In conclusion, we outline some European policy responses in the perspective of building the European Research Area and the European Higher Education Area.",

        "abstract": "During most of the 1970s and 1980s, the number of biomedical Ph.D.'s conferred in the United States was fairly constant. From 1987 to 1995, however, there was an increase of almost 50% in the number of biomedical Ph.D.'s awarded by U.S. institutions; nearly 70% of this increase can be accounted for by the increase in the number of noncitizens receiving a Ph.D. in the U.S. Although unemployment among U.S. citizens with biomedical Ph.D.'s is now extremely low--less than 2.0%--there have been some important changes in the job market for biomedical Ph.D.'s. The total number of biomedical scientists has grown, whereas the number of faculty positions has remained stable, causing a decline in faculty positions as a percentage of total employment for biomedical scientists. Jobs in industry have increased, and in the future might surpass academic jobs as the most prevalent form of employment for U.S. biomedical scientists.",

Bouchet, the first African-American to receive a doctorate from Yale in 1876, are used to model features of the African-American doctoral experience. Bouchet’s early years and educational experiences are discussed to draw references to contemporary research on prior socialization toward doctoral degree completion. His experiences during doctoral study are highlighted to develop conclusions about literature regarding doctoral student socialization frameworks as they relate to the current experiences of African-American students. Furthermore, Bouchet’s life after the doctorate characterizes many issues associated with challenges faced by African-American doctoral degree completers and their postdoctoral degree completion experiences.",

        "abstract": "We examine effects of government spending on postdoctoral researchers' (postdocs) productivity in biomedical sciences, the largest population of postdocs in the US. We analyze changes in the productivity of postdocs before and after the US government's 1997 decision to increase NIH funding. In the first round of analysis, we find that more government spending has resulted in longer postdoc careers. We see no significant changes in researchers' productivity in terms of publication and conference presentations. However, when the population is segmented by citizenship, we find that the effects are heterogeneous; US citizens stay longer in postdoc positions with no change in publications and, in contrast, international permanent residents (green card holders) produce more conference papers and publications without significant changes in postdoc duration. Possible explanations and policy implications of the analysis are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This article examines the development and growth of professional doctorates in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. It provides an overview of the development of the doctoral degree from its establishment at the universities of Paris and Bologna, and highlights the emergence of new forms of doctorates that have challenged the PhD. The examination indicates that similar growth patterns for applied doctorates have occurred in the United States, the UK and in Australia, but contrasting forces in Canada have reshaped existing PhD programs to meet changing external requirements. For each of the countries studied, the relative difficulty in obtaining consistent definitions of professional doctorates, and reliable statistics on the numbers of students enrolled in and graduating from such programs, suggests the need for continuing discussions within and across countries concerning these emerging professional doctorates.",

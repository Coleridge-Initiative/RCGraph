        "abstract": "A much-touted policy tool to reduce nutrient pollution from livestock agriculture is the nutrient management plan (NMP). NMPs can be voluntary or required, and oblige farms to match the nutrients applied as manure or commercial fertilizer with the absorptive capacity of land and crops. However, little research examines whether these plans are implemented, even if farms have records of having plans. In this paper we use nationally-representative Agricultural and Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data on hog producers to compare the nutrient application practices of farms with and without NMPs to see whether having an NMP makes a farm less likely to over-apply nutrients, as well as to adopt other nutrient management practices. We also examine whether the effect of having an NMP on nutrient management is strengthened by state NMP requirements, proximity to urban areas, regional nutrient balance, and watershed water quality oversight. Our preliminary findings suggest that NMPs are effective in encouraging nutrient testing but not in reducing over application of nutrients to farmland; they have the most effect in states with more stringent regulation.",

        "abstract": "Recent increases in farm real estate values in the United States have increased farm equity. By exploiting periods of high and low appreciation that caused various increases in wealth for farmers owning various shares of their farmland, we examine whether U.S. grain farmers expanded their acres harvested or acres owned in response to an increase in their land wealth. We find that land wealth had little effect on farm size. However, for similarly-sized farms, a larger ownership share (10 percentage points) led to an increase in the growth of land owned (2 percentage points). Because older farmers own more of the land that they farm, greater land appreciation slows the rate at which younger farmers acquire land relative to older farmers.",

Results indicate that farms within the top decile for crop sales receive over two-thirds of the payments from these programs. Recent legislative proposals to implement payment caps on each farm are shown to impact a relatively small percentage of farms that are almost entirely within the top decile of crop sales. However, implementing these caps is likely to result in as much as $2.51 billion in taxpayer savings. These help provide direction for continued efforts to design cost-effective, equitable agricultural safety net policies.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - The aim of this study is to use a financial approach based on the Du Pont expansion to investigate the impact of demographics, specialization, tenure, vertical integration, farm type, and regional location on the three levers of performance (ROE) – namely, net profit margins, asset turnover ratio, and asset-to-equity ratio. Design/methodology/approach - This research uses a system of equations in conjunction with 1996-2009 farm-level data from the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to evaluate the factors driving farm-level profitability, namely, net profit margins, asset turnover ratio, and asset-to-equity ratio. The methodology employed in this study corrects heterogeneity and uses repeated cross-section estimation procedure to estimate the empirical models. Findings - The study finds that key drivers of net profit margins are operator education, farm size and typology, specialization, and level of government payments. Key factors affecting the asset turnover ratio component of the Du Pont model include asset turnover ratio is driven by operator age, contracting, specialization, and receiving government payments. Finally, key factors affecting asset-to-equity ratio component of the Du Pont model are farm size, farm typology, contracting, and specialization drive asset-to-equity ratio. Originality/value - Existing research does not examine the factors affecting returns to equity in faring at the farm-level. Specifically, a micro-level analysis of American farm's future structure and financial performance that accounts for the spatial and inter-temporal dimensions of profitability has never been conducted.",

A shadow cost function is employed to decompose and analyze economic efficiency and scale economies. The study details the development of the data employed in the analysis and focuses on the estimation of scale relationships across farms in different regions and of different sizes. Preliminary results point to important scale economies and suggest that surviving small farms are on average more economically efficient but can exploit scale economies to a much lesser degree than larger farms. The preferred specification of the cost function does not show a region of decreasing returns to scale.",

To accomplish this objective, a multivariate regression procedure and a decade-long pooled state-level cross sections of data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) were used. Among the major findings is the inverse relationship between both income and wealth inequality and factors such as when the famer has a college education or beyond, when the farm is owned partly or fully, and when the farm is located in the Midwestern region. These findings underscore the importance, in terms of policy perspectives aimed at lowering economic inequality, of investing in human capital and in maintaining a stable agricultural economy.",

        "abstract": "In the past three decades, farm families have relied on government payments and off-farm income to reduce income risk and increase total household income. Many studies have analyzed the role of government payments; however, little is known about the impact of health insurance coverage on labor allocation. This study builds on previous literature by using copulas to test for dependence in the labor allocation, addressing the importance of fringe benefits to the farm household, and determining how these considerations affect our knowledge of the impact of fringe benefits on off-farm labor. The results indicate that the off-farm hours worked by the operator and spouse are jointly determined; health insurance coverage is an endogenous variable. Using the predicted probability of insurance coverage and joint estimation techniques, we find a positive and highly significant relationship with the hours worked off-farm. Further, we find that both coupled and decoupled payments are negatively correlated with the hours worked off-farm.Keywords: Health insurance coverage, Endogeneity, Copula, Off-farm labor supply, Dependence, Bivariate tobit, Coupled farm programs payments, Decoupled farm program payments.",

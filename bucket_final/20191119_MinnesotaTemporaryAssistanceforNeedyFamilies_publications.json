        "abstract": "A composite of two descriptive interview studies regarding the implementation and impact of Minnesota's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program on Hmong recipients is presented. The first study was an examination of Hmong engagement with Minnesota's welfare reform program and paid work. The second study was an examination of impacts of the program on the well-being of Hmong families. Both studies found that Hmong participants had difficulty with the program's paid work expectations given limited English, lack of formal education, and low wages. Both studies also emphasized the Hmong's commitment to family caregiving, which conflicted with program work requirements.",

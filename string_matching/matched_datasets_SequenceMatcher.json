There are some cautions associated with address data including; some parolees are showing as AWOL which means the parolee is currently not residing at a known/approved location. In addition, some addresses are actually county jail addresses where parolees are being held pending new criminal charges. Some addresses are treatment facilities, recovery homes, or homeless shelters where offenders may be residing temporarily. Finally, some address are merely places where the parolee meets with the agent but does not actually reside. While it is our policy to verify addresses to the best of our ability, there are a number of offenders who do not wish us to know where they really reside and as such, utilize the address of a family member or friend who they know will provide assurance that the parolee resides there. Also please note, addresses are input by Agents so there are always possibilities that human errors are contained in the dataset. These are a few of the reasons why we do not create policy based on address, as a number of our parolees live a transient lifestyle and do not necessarily reside where they work or commit new crimes.\n\n\nPlease access the full dataset in course database table: ildoc.il_doc_parole\n",

Projections are used for assessing short-range trends in occupational employment and resulting occupational opportunities.

Projected year estimates are a function of national, state and local area variables including industry employment, industry indicators and labor force data.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Collecting and analyzing Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program survey data from 52,000 New York employers on how many individuals they employ in each occupation. The results generate an occupational distribution or staffing pattern for each industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Applying occupational staffing patterns from the OES survey to the industry employment totals to produce base year occupational employment estimates. In turn, expected staffing pattern changes are applied to the base year pattern.  The modified staffing patterns are then applied to projected industry employment levels to obtain projected occupational employment levels.\r\n    \r\n\r\n4) Applying replacement rates to the projected occupational employment levels and adding growth to obtain estimates of occupational openings for approximately 800 specific occupations.",

In order to generate this structure several data manipulation operations were done on the raw QCEW data. Most notably, the QCEW is originally structured at the FIPS/NAICS/Ownership level, with “Ownership” referring to the governmental ownership status of the associated establishments(e.g. private, federal government, local government, etc). In order to reduce the dataset to the FIPS/NAICS level, the raw location quotients were combined using weighted averages based on establishment count. In addition, county/NAICS combinations that did not pass BLS’ disclosure standards are not included and state level statistics for each industry are not included.",

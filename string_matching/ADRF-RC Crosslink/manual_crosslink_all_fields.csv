Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample ""market basket"" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same ""market basket"" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base period.


The CPI publishes indexes for two populations; all urban consumers (CU) and urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW). This dataset is for all urban consumers.


To construct the two indexes, thousands of prices for commodities and services purchased by consumers are collected in a sample of 75 urban places. Rent data is collected in a separate sample of thousands of rental units. Comparison of indexes for individual CMSA's or cities show only the relative change over time in prices between locations. These indexes cannot be used to measure interarea differences in price levels or living costs.",provider-224,11

adrf-000036,Illinois Department of Corrections (DOC) Parolee address data - 2009-2015,Illinois Department of Corrections,"Location information for persons active in the Illinois parole system from 2009 to 2015. A given person could have multiple rows in this table, one per year they were on parole. Each row contains a latitude/longitude coordinate based on the parolee’s address on file (redacted from this file), as well as additional information on original and derived county, city, and zip code and metadata that indicates who confident we are that the point corresponds to the address. Because the parole system doesn’t include historical data, parolees who exited the system before 2009 won’t be represented in this data set.


From IDOC:
please note you are receiving parolee address information as of the last day of the FY for all active parolees for the added period in question. There are some cautions associated with address data including; some parolees are showing as AWOL which means the parolee is currently not residing at a known/approved location. In addition, some addresses are actually county jail addresses where parolees are being held pending new criminal charges. Some addresses are treatment facilities, recovery homes, or homeless shelters where offenders may be residing temporarily. Finally, some address are merely places where the parolee meets with the agent but does not actually reside. While it is our policy to verify addresses to the best of our ability, there are a number of offenders who do not wish us to know where they really reside and as such, utilize the address of a family member or friend who they know will provide assurance that the parolee resides there. Also please note, addresses are input by Agents so there are always possibilities that human errors are contained in the dataset. These are a few of the reasons why we do not create policy based on address, as a number of our parolees live a transient lifestyle and do not necessarily reside where they work or commit new crimes.

adrf-000065,New York City 2010 Census Tract to 2010 Neighborhood Tabulation Area Equivalency,Department of City Planning (DCP),"Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) were created to project populations at a small area level, from 2000 to 2030 for PlaNYC, the long-term sustainability plan for New York City. Since population size affects the error associated with population projections, these geographic units needed to have a minimum population, which were determined to be 15,000. This criterion resulted in combinations of neighborhoods that probably would not occur if one were solely designating boundaries of historical neighborhoods. Moreover, the neighborhood names associated with the neighborhood tabulation areas are not intended to be definitive.


Another feature of the sustainability plan, was the creation of projections for Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), which are approximations of New York City's Community Districts developed for use with the Census Bureau's Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). In order to make the boundaries consistent with PUMAs, NTAs were created using whole census tracts, from the 2010 census, within PUMAs. Since NTAs were not permitted to cross PUMA boundaries, this further restricted our ability to identify what may be thought of as historical neighborhood boundaries.


Thus, users need to be cognizant of the reason why NTAs were created and the demographic/geographic constraints inherent in how they were configured. Despite these limitations, NTAs are a valuable summary level for use with both the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). Regarding the decennial census, these geographic areas offer a good compromise between the very detailed data for census tracts (2,168) and the broad strokes provided by community districts (59). For the ACS, NTAs offer a statistically reliable alternative to the high sampling error that renders data for most individual census tracts unusable.


Note: ""park-cemetery-etc"" NTAs, while not contiguous, only represent five unique NTAs; one in each borough. However, each of these five NTAs may appear more than once in this table, as they may fall in more than one PUMA.",27

Because the spell files contain the time-varying history of benefits receipt for individuals and cases, only the most recent version of these tables is presented.  As such, this data is presented as time-invariant, with one record of each characteristic for a given individual or case, even though some characteristics (like case addresses) obviously do vary over time.

1) Developing industry employment totals for the base year and industry employment estimates for the projected year. Projected year estimates are a function of national, state and local area variables including industry employment, industry indicators and labor force data.


2) Collecting and analyzing Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program survey data from 52,000 New York employers on how many individuals they employ in each occupation. The results generate an occupational distribution or staffing pattern for each industry.


3) Applying occupational staffing patterns from the OES survey to the industry employment totals to produce base year occupational employment estimates. In turn, expected staffing pattern changes are applied to the base year pattern.  The modified staffing patterns are then applied to projected industry employment levels to obtain projected occupational employment levels.

adrf-000104,Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U),Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure of change, over time, of the prices of goods and services in major expenditure groups--such as food, housing, apparel, transportation, and medical care--typically purchased by urban consumers. Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample ""market basket"" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same ""market basket"" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base period.


The CPI publishes indexes for two populations; all urban consumers (CU) and urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW). This dataset is for all urban consumers.


To construct the two indexes, thousands of prices for commodities and services purchased by consumers are collected in a sample of 75 urban places. Rent data is collected in a separate sample of thousands of rental units. Comparison of indexes for individual CMSA's or cities show only the relative change over time in prices between locations. These indexes cannot be used to measure interarea differences in price levels or living costs.",11

Raw QCEW data was downloaded from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's website (https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm). In order to generate this structure several data manipulation operations were done on the raw QCEW data. Most notably, the QCEW is originally structured at the FIPS/NAICS/Ownership level, with “Ownership” referring to the governmental ownership status of the associated establishments(e.g. private, federal government, local government, etc). In order to reduce the dataset to the FIPS/NAICS level, the raw location quotients were combined using weighted averages based on establishment count. In addition, county/NAICS combinations that did not pass BLS’ disclosure standards are not included and state level statistics for each industry are not included.",11

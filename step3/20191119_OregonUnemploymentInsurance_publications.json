            "abstract": "This article asks whether Muslims whose religious beliefs prevent investment in their employers\u2019 private pension plans have a right to religious accommodation. This is a real issue for a growing part of the population whose spiritual lives are governed by rules that prohibit the giving or taking of interest. As one might expect, the investments available through most American pension plans involve some aspect of interest making those investments unsuitable retirement vehicles for devote Muslims. Consequently, in order to secure their retirement income, Muslims are faced with either violating their religious beliefs, losing years of investment opportunity as they wait for the American investment market to catch up to their religious needs, relying on their employer\u2019s goodwill, or religious accommodation through court or statute. Religious accommodation in the workplace is governed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act (Title VII). The statute is directive and punitive. There are potential money damages if an employer does not comply with Title VII\u2019s religious accommodation requirement but no benefit (monetary or otherwise) in exchange for compliance. The two Supreme Court decisions that look at religious accommodation under Title VII concern private employers asked to rearrange employee work schedules to accommodate Sabbatarians. Where the employer faced a potential penalty for failure to provide religious accommodation but no benefit for compliance with the statute\u2019s requirements, the Court treated the Title VII accommodation obligation as an Establishment of religion and as a burden on the non-believers\u2019 Free Exercise rights. Accordingly, the Court diminished Congress\u2019 religious accommodation rule under Title VII to the point that no motivated employer need ever accommodate an employee\u2019s religious practice.Not all religious accommodations occur in the same context. As opposed to religious accommodation under Title VII, the Court generally gives Congress great deference when the legislature bestows tax benefits in exchange for taxpayers eschewing even constitutionally protected activities. Private pension plans are founded on tremendous tax benefits bestowed on retirement accounts by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). These benefits invoke the deference to Congress exhibited in the Court\u2019s tax decisions rather than the hostility to forced religious accommodation reflected in its Title VII decisions.",

            "abstract": "Three models were developed for spatially projecting the demand for waste collection service by manufacturing, retail, and service businesses, and were compared with a model commonly used for this purpose. Model I is similar to most earlier work in which unit demand rates (kg employee \u22121 wk \u22121 ) are estimated for a variety of businesses. These rates are then multiplied by the number of employees in the area being modeled. Model II differs from Model I in that unit demand rates are estimated for businesses of different sizes (number of employees), rather than activities. In Model III businesses are cross-classified by both activity and size, and then unit demand rates are estimated within each class. Data for model estimation were obtained by weighing waste deposited for collection by 435 businesses over a 25-wk period in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan region. Business size accounted for significantly more of the variation in unit demand rate than did business activity. This suggests that demand models used in planning solid waste collection and disposal systems can be improved by including indicators of business size.",
